The future of r/robotics,143,1494iu5,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1494iu5/the_future_of_rrobotics/,22,"##r/robotics went dark June 12th to 14th

Along with everyone else, we set the subreddit to private only June 12th to 14th, in protest of Reddit admins plan to kill 3rd party apps. You may have tried to access the subreddit, and seen this message:

> This sub has gone private in protest of changes being made by Reddit, along with and in solidarity with many others.
> ---- What happened:  https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/

> ---- Where you can still find us: https://discord.gg/sbueZeC the Robotics Discord

##So what?

There's some legitimate issues with the status quo that the Reddit admins are trying to deal with, but their course of action, the way they have conducted themselves, shows utter contempt for the community, the quality of the Reddit user experience. Again, [we suggest reading the explanation from the Apollo App dev](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/). 

##The future of r/robotics

###After June 30th, you can expect the quality of the r/robotics community to decline.
You can expect more spam posts, spam bots, and a likely increase in toxic behaviour. By killing 3rd party apps, Reddit is removing the tools that r/robotics moderators use to support the community. None of the mod team are interested in having our unpaid volunteering made harder, by people who clearly don't respect us, or care about you, in exchange for a worse user experience. So we're not planning to figure out a solution to the problem that Reddit corporate has created.

###We're confident that the robotics industry will outlive any social media platform.

[We already have a Discord community](https://discord.gg/sbueZeC), and we're looking into alternative platforms. We were planning an overhaul to our moderation team, to get more people involved. But we don't just want to recruit a bunch of people to work without meaning or reward. 

I've been moderating this community for 10 years, with support from many wonderful people in recent years. We're all professional roboticists, we don't enjoy moderating, we enjoy supporting the community. [We love seeing the robots you build, that's why since the pandemic, we've run a annual online showcase, which is unique in being for people of any age and ability.](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1495g52/debrief_the_3rd_reddit_robotics_showcase/)",1686739130.0

Best robotic lawnmower for a double lot? Husqvarna Automower vs others?,1,15245ka,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/15245ka/best_robotic_lawnmower_for_a_double_lot_husqvarna/,0,"I was considering the 430x for my double lot, im not positive but i think generally that size is 120 foot long  by 80 foot.  (might mean 500+ feet of wire, does the 430x come with wire, or can it use any type)?

Are there any good alternatives (yet) than the 430x, any with gps mapping (i've seen some 3rd party ones but i guess that tech is too new and not trusted).

My yard is mostly flat, i have a pool with rocks around it (above ground).  I have a fence in the backyard but the gate is usually open.  I have one 3 foot by say 100 section of grass on one side of a paved driveway (probably cant even cut that with the robot).

I have a front yard with a sidewalk in the middle and parts of the sidewalk would probably require a little bit of ahop to get over it (2""?) to cut both sides.

From what i understand even with a fence, there must be boundary wire (right at the edge?) and buried everywhere ideally (sounds like a ton of work on this double lot), i get boundary vs guide mixed up at this point i think.

Any experiences with this model or others?  I see a lot of positives on the 430x, but there also seems to be some warning on warranties at least off amazon?

Also, whats to keep someone walking down the street from just reaching into the front yard and swiping the mower?

I have a ground hog and rabbits (suburbs), can you put pvc around the guide wire, or is there stronger guide/boundary wire to deal with that? (or i should find a way to remove the ground hog)  


How does the 430x deal with a stump, just goes around it?

Is the ESP32 the king of boards?,11,1519mw8,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1519mw8/is_the_esp32_the_king_of_boards/,10,"So I was about to purchase a few raspberry pi pico W the other day, plus some arduinos nano (the one that has wifi), but I remembered theres the ESP32...

I have 2 projects:

1. Educational robot for kids/adults with 2-3 basic sensors. Line folloer, motiom detection and temperature sensor.

2. Home water tank real time level meter. Using a waterproof ultrasonic sensor, capture the data and send it to free tier VPS database (http requests to a Django app APi) render the data using React.js and in mobile using React Native. 

Right now I only have:

A. Raspberry pi 3B+
--too big and expensive for what my project requirements.

B Arduino UNO R3
---has no wifi or bluetooth, and I dont want to add a HAT etc.

I came to the conculsion to use something the size and form factor of either the:

1. Raspberry pi pico W
2. Arduino nano RP2040 
3. ESP32 (not sure which development board since theres alot)

So I was doing a fast research and the ESP32 development boards beats the other boards in price and performance. 

One thing I read about the ESp32 is that consumes very little power. 

Basically what Im trying to ask is:

1. Is the ESP32 my right path?

2. Can you code the ESP32 using the arduino IDE, python and scratch blocks? 

3. Do they make esp32 clones or should I get the original ones?

4. What model of ESP32 dev board should I get? Ive seen theres ESP32 S series or C series etc...Theres even one that has a built-in camera which would be awesome for the robot.

5. Which 3 of the boards is more widely used around the world? I would guess the esp32?

6. Can you build a product and use the esp32 as the board and then commercialize it? 

7. What are some real world commercial products we have seen that uses the esp32 but have no idea it uses the esp32? 

8. Is the esp32 the king of development boards? I know they even sell you the bare chip or module...but the boards looks fantastic.

9. Last one, can you use an ESP32 to host a web app? For example I used my raspberry pi3b+ to serve a Django app in my LAN, also a wordpress site. Not sure about microcontrollers capable of doing that?noob here....

Sorry for all the questions Im just really curious about the esp32 and purhasing it. I still going to buy atleast 1 pico W and 1 nano rp2040 to compare them all 3, but not sure why I think the esp32 is the king.

What are your thoughts or answers about the esp32?

Automation and its Impact on the Economy,3,150mc6a,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/150mc6a/automation_and_its_impact_on_the_economy/,5,"  Project for school, your engagement is appreciated. 

&#x200B;

Robotics and automation are enhancing humans in the workplace more than replacing people or reducing the workforce.  While there is robotics being designed to perform or simplify processes that would result in reduced staff, there is a need for technicians to maintain and repair the machines. Automotive manufacturing is most notably leveraging automation and robotics to supplement the production line (Chung & Lee, 2023). 

There is evidence contributing to the “displacement effect” (Brown, 2020) in which displaced workers take lower-wage positions and result in increased unemployment. While automation can be developed to help and enhance humans, it can also be designed for malicious purposes and dilute the quality of content (Goldsborough, 2016). Side effects of increased automation may translate to increased energy consumption, accelerated resource depletion, and inequality-driven environmental hazards (Joshi, 2021) unless the impacts are planned for and mitigated prior to implementation. 

What do you think about automation? Will it propel humanity into the next revolution or contribute to the degradation of the economy?

Now however I want to switch it to 6 wheel ackerman steering, with 4 wheel steering.

Understanding sensorless impedance control - Matlab implementation,2,14xzxsh,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/14xzxsh/understanding_sensorless_impedance_control_matlab/,2,"Hello,

I'm new to impedance control so after reading some books and watching some videos I think I got the idea of how does it work until I starter doing some maths. Currently I have a 6 axis robot without force sensor so my idea is to implement this control for the robot. Attached an image and explanation. I have some doubts so I would appreciate a feedback if something I is wrong.

So, first comes the feedback linearization where we cancel the nonlinear terms, where tau depends on the computation of the acceleration ""a"". This acceleration comes in form of a impedance model where we have the matrixes ""M"", ""D"" and ""K"" that  defines the behaviour of the system and a force ""Fa"". This imepdance model is writen in cartesian terms so it has to be changed to general ""q"" coordinates in order to apply to the dynamic model of the robot.

alpha=*ddxd*\+*Mm*−1*d*(Dm\*dxe+*Kd*\*xe+*Fa*) 

*¨q*=*J*−1(alpha−*J*˙*q*˙)

So, if we take this ""¨q"" and substitute in the control law: we obtain the last equation:

My question is that I dont understand where the last term of this equation comes from:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/awit9a9nglbb1.png?width=277&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc9ab9f246c9c6bc454966f4a558b39679d17e98

Besides, ""Fa"" force is the force that the enviroment is applying in the robot so, my question is: the ""Fa"" and ""Fext"" are the same?

\----------------------------------------------------------

About the sensorless part I have a doubt about the implementation. As I show in the image if we choose the aparent inertia ""Mm"" and the Model ""M"" withe same value, this last term dissapears so force sensor is not longer needed. My question comes when I started writing the code in matlab, maybe its a silly question but:

Where and how can I simulate an external force and apply into my system if there is no ""Fa"" term in my equations? So sorry, but I'm trying to figure out and I dont see how can I simulate this.

Thanks in advance and I look forward some light into this mess

Over the last 5 months I've been working on a somewhat-new kind of robotics application. The name for the robot is still undecided, but it's main purpose is to pick up and dispose of litter and debris in urban areas, whilst simultaneously distinguishing between what debris goes into recycling and what goes into landfill.

The biggest inspiration for this robot has been the fictional robot from the movie WALL-E. A robot for environmental restoration and reducing pollution. 

Asides from picking up and disposing of trash it finds on the ground, what are some other things this robot should be able to do that contribute to its core purpose of environmental restoration and reduction of pollution / climate change? 

So far I've brain stormed some things like collecting and planting seeds. Or spraying the land with liquid inoculate containing soil-rejuvenating fungi. Or even painting the city with moss inoculate. 

I'll be open sourcing the code and the schematics once I'm finished with this project. I'll also be distributing kits for students and hobbyists interested in building this robot for themselves ( cheaper ), alongside a consumer edition of the robot that is fully built, programmed, and ready to be deployed ( if you don't have the time to build it yourself or if you're just plain lazy ).",1689124940.0

Best wheels for small robot,1,14u2bhz,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/14u2bhz/best_wheels_for_small_robot/,0,"I'm looking for some advice on wheels for a robot competing in [RoboCup maze](https://junior.robocup.org/rcj-rescue-maze/) competitions.

The robot has to navigate a mostly smooth maze with ramps, obstacles, and occasional debris on the ground (small sticks, toothpicks, rocks), so the wheels should have a really good grip for going up ramps while having the optimal design for navigating debris (see image of maze for reference).

We are currently using some rubber-foam [""tractor"" wheels](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004821591840.html), but there's not enough grip, and they're also very big for our application.

We could make our own wheels using 3D-printed molds - in that case, what would be the best design and material? Any suggestions are welcome.

* SLAM algorithms included: gmapping and hector
*  Autonomous navigation
* Possibility to add new worlds in Gazebo from this repository: [https://github.com/macc-n/gazebo\_worlds](https://github.com/macc-n/gazebo_worlds)

Mind Controlled Robotics,2,14syncn,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/14syncn/mind_controlled_robotics/,3,"So I've been working on a robotics project for about 3-5 months now called HIPP-E. HIPP-E is an autonomous rover-like application equipped with a grabber arm. Using image recognition software HIPP-E drives around my neighborhood and collects trash / litter. It also reports signs of a house fire, potentially fatal car collision, or unconscious personnel. This is all a work in progress still in the prototyping stage.

Here recently I started programming some different applications for tele-operation of the robot. So far I have a old-fashioned sort of submarine-radar program and a 3D ray casting program. While I'm waiting for the camera module to arrive I'm experiencing some creative mania and wanted to talk about mind-controlled robotics as a discussion for tele-robotics.

I'm a big fan of the game Atomic Heart, taking place in a fictional Soviet Russia where they have advanced polymer electronics technology as well as sparked technological revolution through mind controlled robotics and hive-mind neural link of humans. 

I know this is somewhat already a possibility by strapping something like a hacked MindFlex toy to your head then have it measure concentration levels. But you can only seem to switch between '1' and '0' with this, high concentration or low concentration. What about specific analog levels of concentration? Sure I can make a robot move forward or not move at all by switching between high and low concentration levels by what if I need to make it move backwards, turn left / right, or lower and use the grabber arm? Or have mind-control hotkeys for the robot like ""play chase"" or ""fetch this"" ? 

Essentially, past my caffeine-induced babbling, how easy would it be to achieve and switch between / activate analog concentration levels for more control of a robot?",1688710827.0

I have an idea in mind for a passion project however as I am new to building robotics outside of highschool lego nxt and one arduino projects. I want to know if this is possible.  


**The Idea:**  
I had the idea of an underwater communicator that may be wearable on the wrist. I myself scuba dive and one of the most difficult parts is communication. It would be interesting to make a watch with ""quick chats"" with basic functions and a partner watch. In scuba diving you typically are paired up with a buddy and thier are many things to communicate, these include:  
\- Your PSI (How much air you have left)  
\- If you notice formations or wildlife  
\- Come here/Distance yourself  
\- whether you want to lead or follow  
\- Any issues (mask leaking, air freeflow ect)

 It would be interesting to make a watch that would not only beep or vibrate when the divers get a set distance from each other, maybe a few buttons (one for come here, one for distance, follow me, help, safety stop, and most importantly, a place where you can update your psi) The psi would have a last updated time where you inputted your air pressure, as well as a button where you can request for the other to share PSI.  


**Issues:**  
To begin with I am not familiar with how the electronics will interact with water. Sure I could do test watches that work above water, but it would be nice to eventually try in the intended setting. Next I am unaware how the radio functions would work. Aside from microbit I haven't dealt with connections from computer to computer. Finally I am unsure of where to start. I know my fair share of programming languages and I know how to build things/tinker.  


I would however love to hear ideas, tips, or any advice before trying this idea out!",1688427508.0
Odd robotics request!,4,14pvd3k,robotics,https://i.redd.it/3kjjef53it9b1.jpg,2,"Any help is appreciated! This question is coming from someone with no robotics experience, just in desperate need. My dog has severe separation anxiety and we recently found out that keeping a human-sized prop doll (courtesy of Spirit Halloween) with him while we leave calmed him down. It has recently stopped working and I have a hunch that if the doll moved at all and maybe pet him every now and then, it would continue working. Does anyone have recommendations for a robotic arm we could attach to the doll that would allow us some of the following functions??

- remote/app-based control that we could use outside of the home
- some kind of petting-adjacent function that would be gentle and wouldn’t pinch him
- could attach to stuffed doll 😳

Hope you are doing just fine.  


I am working on a rc car that is controlled by a raspberry pi 2b and I would like to ask you some questions.   


I am a little it confused with the 5V pin and the current that the 5v pin can offer me.

As you can see in this picture, I am trying to build a schematic and I have about 9 leds to add more in this schematic.

&#x200B;

To supply the pi I will use a 5v power bank that can give 2.4 amps of current through the microusb cable.

The problem is that now I realized that I don't know if the 5V pin is enough to power all the things up. I did calculate the total current consumption of the leds, the gps module, the metal detector, the pi camera and the pi itself and the total value is 1.1-1.2 amps. ( 545 for the sensors and the leds and 550 for the camera and the raspberry pi).   
Is there any chance that I will fry something up if I do connect all of the electronics or it is still safe ?  


I tried looking on some data sheets but I got really lost because I am still a newbie in this field.

3. Do all beginners and professional PCBs designs are sent to Asia for manufacturing? Are there any in the United States or Europe?
4. If I wanted to duplicate and add to my main PCB board the exact design of an Arduino UNO or nano, is it legal or opensource free to use for starting entrepreneurs?
5. Do PCB manufacturers have limits to the size or complexity of your boards? For example if I wanted to just manufacture 3 LEDs and 1 resistor will they do it?

Piston Idea,4,14lled4,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/14lled4/piston_idea/,5,"I'm thinking of making a piston driven by a BLDC motor with a reversible car ESC. The motor will have a wheel attached to it, the wheel will be making contact with an inner tube and driving it forward and backward (a rubber band will be around the wheel to increase friction). Illustrated below:

The front of the outer tube is closed of with a hole allowing only the inner tube to pass (not the large block attach to the end of the inner tube), the inner tube will have something larger attached to the end so the inner tube can't come out of the larger tube.

I was wondering can't I drive the bldc motor until a spike in current is reached at the two extremes then stop the motor instead of using limit switches. I think I'll be monitoring the current using a ads1115 module with an arduino but I haven't decided yet. Maybe I could use some springs at the extremes for the current spike instead of having the piston hit a solid stop. Will this decrease the life expectancy of the ESC and motor?

I'm posting this just to check if there's anything stupid I've missed because I haven't seen anyone make anything like this.

Soft Linear Actuators (Artificial Muscles,2,14l9pce,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/14l9pce/soft_linear_actuators_artificial_muscles/,4,"Hello everyone,

I spend a lot of time looking for the perfect soft actuator to function as actificial Muscles.
There is a lot of different types Out there but almost all of them have one or more critical drawback that make them Not suitable.

There are a couple of ways to activate them wich I looked into:

-Heat
-Electeicity (Electromagnetic)
-Chemically

Heating Actuators (especially Nitinol SMA Wire) offer a lot of great Features but for usage as Artificial Muscles they Lack (repeatable) actuation Speed. They can react pretty fast If you blast them with enough electricity (Resistance heating) or Heat but cooling them is a Problem. 
Those Materials only become flexible again after being cooles down.. Liquid cooling Makes everything way more bulky and somewhat complicated so those Actuators are sadly Out of Question.

Chemical Actuators need to be exposed to (you guessed it) chemicals. Storing and providing them is Not easy and thus too Out of Question.

Fully Electric Actuators that dont use Heat to actuator are the Most promising to me. Especially being able to ""Turn them Off"" almost instantly is a great plus. Also controlling and providing electricity is easier then the other Methods mentioned above.

What's also critical for the soft Actuators:

-High Strain (> 75% better >100%) 
Needed to provide the needed range of motion.

-Actuation Speed (full contraction in <0,5s at least!)
No use in Artificial Muscles that need Several Seconds to fully actuate.

-Actuation Frequency (>1HZ at least)
The Actuators need to actuate fully at least once a Second or more to be able to recreate quick repeatable movement.

-Strenght (equal or even Higher strengt then Natural Muscles)
Again, No use as Artificial Muscles If they cannot produce any force.

What seems to be the Most promising Options for me (what I found) are:

Dielectric Elastomer Actuators (stacked):

+High Actuation Frequency
+Actuation Speed can be sufficient
+Fully Electric

-high voltage required (Most of them)
-Actuation Strain can be on the lower end..

PVC Gel Actuators:

+Speed
+Fully Electric
+Lower voltage then DEAs

-limited Strain

CNT (Carbon Nanotube) Aerogel Actuator

+High Strain
+High Speed
+Fully Electric

-High Voltage
-strain only in one Dimension needs to be redirected to provide lateral actuation (expanding Diameter to shorten the length somewhat Mc Kibbon Style)

Are there any other fitting types of actuators I dont know of? 

I think there are some CNT Actuators (without Aerogel) that are promising..

Maybe some Kind of Magnetic/Electrically Active Fluid/Gel? Pulling it appart tonagain increase Diameter and thus contract??

Any ideas?

"Capturing 100 images, analyzing in real time, creating a histogram - using mirrors and 2MP camera",19,14kipjp,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/14kipjp/capturing_100_images_analyzing_in_real_time/,10,"I'm dealing with an unusual situation that involves using a low-resolution (2MP) camera alongside a dual-mirror, servo-driven system. The goal is to count small fruit on a tree by dividing the tree into a grid of 100 ""tiles"" (10x10). Each tile is then scanned using the mirror setup, and the 2MP camera captures individual images of each tile. Afterward, the camera counts the number of fruit in each tile, subsequently generating a 10x10 histogram where each of the 100 bins represents a tile and its corresponding fruit count.

However, I'm uncertain whether this is the most efficient strategy. Two main reasons that influence the decision to go with this algorithm are: a) I already own the required sensor, and b) using machine learning to count the fruit in each 2MP image on the go is faster than counting all the fruit at once from a larger 50MP image.

At the moment, I have a 2MP FLIR Blackfly S camera that has been modified for the visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectrum. Alongside this, I have a FLIR Boson 640 LWIR radiometric camera that collects other data like fruit temperature. This camera will also employ the same tiling system to capture images of the tree and calculate the average temperature of the fruit in each tile.

The FLIR camera can trigger via an external hardware trigger.  Therefore, the algorithm would be:

1. Position the mirrors to face TILE 01
2. Release hardware trigger for camera, capture 2MP image
3. Jetson Nano or a similar board counts the number of fruit in TILE 01
4. Reposition the mirrors to face TILE 02
5. ... repeat until all 100 tiles are captured and analyzed.

Any ideas or suggestions would be appreciated.  Including a better way of designing or implementing this system.",1687884233.0

Second post here, I hope you are doing just fine.  


I was wondering if you could help me with some info about a project I am trying to build.  


Basically, I am trying to build a 3d printed RC car that uses 2 x 12 v dc motors to move.  
I decided that I will use a LiPo 3s which I think it will be enough to power up the motors.

As for the control of the motors I will use a l298n ( h bridge ).  
The car will be controled with a raspberry pi 2 b.  
The problem is that I decided to use an external power bank to power up the Pi. I wouldn't try to connect the raspberry to the 5V pin on the l298n.  
The power bank that I have has a capacity of 5000mah, which I think it is enough, and can give up to 2.4 amps.  
But I'm a little bit confused because my rc car has some some additional sensors and a camera module. Basically I have a neo 6m, an audio sensor, a wi-fi module and a raspberry pi 2 camera.  
I tried to calculate an approximate value for the consumed current and I think that 1.2-1.3 amps was the total current. But I was wondering if the Pi would draw this value through the micro usb cable or should I try to find another solution? I don't really understand if the pi will draw all the current it needs or it is limited to a maximum value through the micro-usb cable?

What eyes (camera) to use for obstace avoidance on drones,2,14jlx0c,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/14jlx0c/what_eyes_camera_to_use_for_obstace_avoidance_on/,4,"I work for a drone startup and currently researching on what light weight and economical cameras I can use for precise obstacle avoidance (avoid trees,wires and poles).
Current stopping distance for my drone is 20m and hence I plan to use radar (around 200$) for long range obstacle detection. However radars are not precise, hence I have opted to use cameras as additional sensors for precise avoidance. 
I am not using a 2d lidar because it doesnot have a vertical fov necessary to detect wires (stereo can't detect wires). 3d lidars having a range of 20m are heavy and expensive. Hence can you suggest on what cameras I should use and how to evaluate them?.
Based on current research I have narrowed down (range, weight and cost) on Oak d lite, Intel 455 and zed2 mini with a range of 6,6 and 10 m respectively.

Question About Max Charging Amperage for Battery and PSU Setup for SyRen Motor Driver,1,14jkqyy,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/14jkqyy/question_about_max_charging_amperage_for_battery/,1,"Hello!

I'm working on creating a small robotic installation using a this [Syren 50 Amp motor driver](https://www.dimensionengineering.com/products/syren50) with an Arduino and would like to hook it up to an external power supply while it is running.

When I was looking into how to do this, [I found this page on the manufacturer's website](https://www.dimensionengineering.com/appnotes/atxguide/atxguide.htm) that recommends that I only do this if a 12 volt battery is wired in parallel to the PSU since the driver is regenerative and will send current back into whatever is powering it, but I am not sure if it would be safe to hook a battery with a max charging current that is lower than the draw from the motor that I am using and/or the max current from the PSU.

My very limited understanding is that the battery essentially absorbs any charge that is sent back from the driver to prevent it from tripping any fail safes in the PSU, and that the PSU will ensure that the battery is continually charged during operation.

Would there be any risk of the battery overheating if I'm using a 12v 7ah SLA battery with [this 30amp PSU that I got for another project](https://www.amazon.com/eTopxizu-Universal-Regulated-Switching-Computer/dp/B00D7CWSCG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1463569496&sr=8-1&keywords=12V+30+amp+power+supply&linkCode=sl1&tag=nc07d-20&linkId=f285f06c6e64d8448ff5aaebdae1bcd7) if the motor that I am driving is drawing a lot of current?

When I was looking at the tutorial that the manufacturer provided, it seems like the max amperage put out by the power supply they recommended was way over the max charging current of one of the batteries that they were recommending for this purpose.

This is my first time working with a device that is capable of putting out larger currents and I'm admittedly not super well versed in electronics or batteries so any advice on how to do this safely or recommendations in regard to where I could find this information would be greatly appreciated!",1687794175.0

I'm diving into the world of robotics and seeking some guidance from the knowledgeable folks. I've been on the lookout for existing robotics clubs or groups in my city (Barcelona, Spain), but to my surprise, I haven't found any solid leads. It seems like physical meetups for robotics enthusiasts are not too popular around here as most of what I've found are for kids or teens. That's why I'm turning to this Reddit community for some advice on how to either establish a new club or find an existing one tha would be more focuse in an adult audience.

If any of you have experience in starting a robotics club or have insights on how to go about it, I would greatly appreciate your input.

I was thinking maybe something like:

\- How could I find people around interested? (Meetup wasn't too much of a help)

\-  What would be the essential steps to setting up a new robotics club from scratch if I'm not able to find one? 

\- If anyone is from around, do you know if there are any local resource or university that I could reach out to for potential support?

\- What would be your top recommendation as online community, forum or platform to connect to other people interested in robotics? (Most of the one's I've seen are quite neglected :( )

&#x200B;

 I value any advice, tips, or suggestions you can offer!

P.S: I think it could be a bit related, as a similar club for AI would maybe help me finding people interested since they share a lot of enthusiastics. ",1687739385.0
Project ROVER is a new robotic platform being developed for law enforcement and emergency services.,0,14jj4s1,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/14jj4s1/project_rover_is_a_new_robotic_platform_being/,3,"&#x200B;

**ROVER** is a small four wheeled robot equipped with a variety of sensors, devices and capabilities, including BLE tracking, real time camera viewing, RF Grid mapping, deployable bi directional amplifier and a dedicated cellular network. **ROVER** can be used for a variety of tasks such as search and rescue, patrol, evidence collection, disaster response and active shooter response. The **ROVER** is still under development, but it could be a valuable tool for law enforcement.

Here are some of the key benefits of using **ROVER**:

**- Increased officer safety:** ROVER can help improve officer safety by allowing officers to enter dangerous or hazardous environments without putting themselves at risk.

**-Improved Situational Awareness:** ROVER can help improve officers' situational awareness by providing officers with real time images of their environment. This can help officers identify potential threats and make better decisions.

**-Increased Efficiency:** ROVER can help increase officer efficiency by allowing officers to focus on other tasks, such as crime scene investigation or medical care.

**-Long term cost effectiveness:** While the initial investment in developing and implementing robots can be significant, they can provide long term cost savings. Robots can perform repetitive and routine tasks with high accuracy and consistency, reducing the need for human labor in such areas.

This technology offers unprecedented levels of benefit, value and efficiency. It not only enhances asset security and protection, but also optimizes resource allocation, streamlines operations and brings peace of mind to those who rely on a robust security infrastructure.

All in all, Project **ROVER** is a promising new technology that can improve the security and efficiency of law enforcement.

 My most efficient and closests to a human walking i can think of is to have the legs be independent from the rest, to spare resources and also lower risk for wierd servos shakes and feedback. 

I was thinking of programming it so the lowers body only occupation is to maintain balancing with the legs. All while the upper body controls the rest. 

By tilting the body forward and backwards a little the legs gyro will sense the imbalance and initiate walking forward or backwards, just like humans do. Controlled fall. By reflex. 

Legs will faster and harder depend on how fast he's falling, always catching his steps. Kinda like the vision dynamics robots.

Is there a better or simpler way to achieve this?

This robot is equipped with a two-way audio transmission system - in order to be able to use this robot as a secure communication line at a time when the frequencies of mobile and other communications are jammed.

In addition, this function can be useful if someone hid from the shooter and he does not have the ability to call or does not have a mobile phone.

Thus, two-way communication with law enforcement agencies can be used. Also, this function can be useful for people search or other sound notification - as it uses 2 speakers with a power of 2 watts.

&#x200B;

The system is equipped with an image stabilizer with a PTZ camera with night vision - this allows you to get a high-quality image even when the car is moving very fast or is tilted. In addition, the camera is equipped with additional lights. The camera has the ability to rotate 360 degrees, as well as tilt up and down. This also allows a better view of the area before the rapid response team enters the premises.

Homing motors when encoder occurs before gearbox?,4,14fhqw6,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/14fhqw6/homing_motors_when_encoder_occurs_before_gearbox/,28,"Hi everyone, during my research, I can’t seem to find examples of what mechanism or technique is used for homing robot arms when the encoder occurs before the gearbox.

My understanding is that encoders before the gearbox are easy to mount because the encoder (for example magnetic encoder) can be mounted to the rear of the motor. But since the angle of the motor shaft doesn’t equate to the angle of the output gearbox shaft, how are robot arms being homed such that their output position is always known?

I could not find examples of homing in action, so any insight is greatly appreciated!

And as a second question, it seems putting an encoder at the output side would be really convenient in terms of measuring the output shaft angle, but I could not find actual examples of this situation being used and how it was executed. And I cannot tell what’s being used: magnetic encoders, shaft encoders, something else?

Powering my robots,5,14fcxu4,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/14fcxu4/powering_my_robots/,7,"Hello everyone, Lately I've been getting into robotics, I was learning about closed loop control, path control, and so on. but the one problem I have trouble solving is how to power my robots in a nice and easy way, currently they all use a simple 9v battery which.. is not the best solution, especially if I want a robot that can be charged easily.

I was thinking about using a LiPo with a circuit similar to what GreatScott! made on his ty channel, that can protect the battery \\ charge it \\ boost the voltage, so any tips on that would be great :) !

Currently I tried to connect a power bank to a boost converter, however I couldn't boost the voltage for some reason (It did work on my 9V that was boosted to -> 12V) , I don't think there should be an inherent problem to boosting a voltage from a power-bank, or am I wrong ? 

also, to make the robots a bit more autonomous I wanted the charging port of the powerbank (or battery) to have a magnetic usb cable that way a wheeled robot can just connect itself to power with a path control or something similar, so a battery with just a single port is not ideal.

Honestly the lipo supercharger by scott is great, but it's diy and I don't have the necessary precision tools to make this (and regardless the input charging current is a bit low I think)

VESC/ODRIVE or DIY PID Controller,2,14enaib,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/14enaib/vescodrive_or_diy_pid_controller/,6,"Hi!
So I was wandering at which point it makes sense to use an ESC with sensorfeedback (like the VESC or the ORDIVE).

A bit of backstory:
In my previous robot, I used a simple H-bridge and rotary encoder to controll my DC motors with a PID running on an ESP32. For the next version I want to use BLDC motors (size should be about 6354). For those motors I was then looking for ways of controlling them and I came across VESC and ODRIVE. They are more espensive than regular ESCs but seem to have the ability to use the hall sensors in the motors to controll the speed.

Therefore my question:

What benefit do I get from using a VESC or ODRIVE for controlling the BLDC motors over doing it similar to my old robot and using the motor encoders to controll a cheap ESC with PIDs on a microcontroller?

My background is computer erngineering and I do not have much experience (yet) when working with these ESCs. I would really appreciate tipps if you do have experience working with those! :)",1687295333.0

The sensor is the Samsung S5KGN2 which you can find in (amongst others) the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra and upcoming Google Pixel 8 Pro phones. The module is approx the same size as the RPi HQ modules without lens. This module (dubbed 'C50M') has auto-focus and a 90-degree FoV F1.83 lens. The module has a 22-pin 0.5mm pitch FFC connector with the 'standard' layout for use with Nvidia Jetson and Raspberry Pi boards (exposing 4 CSI-2 lanes). I'll include a conversion cable to plug it in the default 15-pin Nano/Pi connectors as well.

Seeking Help for Robotic Vehicle Project with Robotic Arm (Limited Time and Budget),0,14e9x7y,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/14e9x7y/seeking_help_for_robotic_vehicle_project_with/,5,"Hello fellow Redditors!

I am currently working on an exciting project involving a robotic vehicle equipped with a robotic arm, and I could really use your expertise and guidance. I am seeking assistance from the community to overcome challenges and make this project a success, but I have some limitations to keep in mind.

**Overview**: 

My project entails developing a robotic vehicle that utilizes a Raspberry Pi, a Raspberry Pi camera, and an ultrasonic sensor. The vehicle is driven by four motors controlled by an L298N driver, while a six-axis robotic arm mounted on top of the vehicle is driven by servo motors (SG5010 and SG90) connected to a PCA9685 servo driver board.

  
The primary goal of this project is to enable the vehicle to autonomously detect objects using computer vision techniques with the Raspberry Pi camera. Additionally, the ultrasonic sensor assists in calculating the distance to the detected objects, allowing for accurate depth estimation.   
Once an object is detected, the robotic arm comes into action, precisely manipulating the object out of the vehicle's path to clear obstacles. The vehicle then continues along its designated path until another obstacle is encountered, repeating the process.   
 

**Seeking Help:** I am reaching out to the Reddit community for assistance in the following areas:

1. **Computer Vision**: I am looking for advice and resources on implementing robust object recognition and tracking algorithms using the Raspberry Pi camera. Since I have a limited budget, any affordable or open-source solutions would be highly appreciated.
2. **Servo Motor Control**: I would greatly appreciate any guidance or code examples for effectively controlling the servo motors (SG5010 and SG90) using the PCA9685 servo driver board. I'm trying to work with the resources I already have, as I cannot purchase any additional hardware due to the imminent deadline.
3. **Autonomous Navigation**: If anyone has experience with autonomous navigation algorithms or obstacle avoidance techniques for robotic vehicles, I would love to hear your insights and suggestions. Since I have limited time, any simplified or efficient approaches would be incredibly helpful.
4. **General Advice**: Any general tips, best practices, or lessons learned from similar projects would be highly valuable in ensuring the success of my endeavor. I am particularly interested in hearing from those who have worked within time and budget constraints.  


Please keep in mind that I have only 3 days left to complete this project, and I cannot afford any fancy technology or additional hardware due to my school project's deadline. I am making the most of the resources I already have.

I am open to any suggestions, resources, or personal experiences that could aid me in overcoming challenges and improving my project while staying within my limitations. Your support would not only help me advance this project but also contribute to the knowledge and growth of the community.

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance. I'm eager to hear your thoughts and learn from your expertise!",1687264389.0

I just started to learn [Autoware.ai](https://autoware.ai/) and I was trying to integrate it with Carla [0.9.10.1](https://0.9.10.1/).  In Carla repository, it is specified that the HD Maps provided along  with the simulator follow a left-hand-coordinate system. When I  visualize this map in Rviz, it is indeed mirrored as ROS follows  right-hand-coordinate system. Because of this the ego vehicle's position  does not match with the position in Rviz map.

How can I convert the default pcd maps to right-hand-coordinate system?

Would quicksilver be a good fuel?,0,14cldhm,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/14cldhm/would_quicksilver_be_a_good_fuel/,7,"I am not sure if this is an appropriate question for this sub, but I really wanted an answer from someone who actually deals with robots. Feel free to direct me to another sub if it is too out there. I am not a robotics engineer by the way, I just like reading.

So, I took a peak at Aristotle’s “On the Soul” and I was intrigued by this particular excerpt:

>“(…)Some go so far as to hold that the movements which the soul imparts to the body in which it is are the same in kind as those with which it itself is moved. An example of this is Democritus, who uses language like that of the comic dramatist Philippus, who accounts for the movements that Daedalus imparted to his wooden Aphrodite by saying that he poured quicksilver into it; (…)”  
>  
>Aristotle, *On the Soul*, pg.7

So, I was wondering, would quicksilver actually be a good fuel for a robot? As in, could you make a fully articulated robot, with human like movements, using quicksilver as its “blood” (major public safety concerns aside)? 

I understand Philippus’s description draws from the belief of his time that quicksilver was a living substance, but I was intrigued due to my previous familiarity with Daedalus’ other moving statues, so I wanted to know wether or not quicksilver would work as well as these guys thought it would.

"SLAM, the direct method preferred by VR giants",62,14asdvr,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/14asdvr/slam_the_direct_method_preferred_by_vr_giants/,25,"**On May 17, 2023, Meta announced the** **results of its cooperation with BMW on in-vehicle AR/VR. The picture above is a screenshot of the promotional video.**

**SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is a technology that locates its own position and attitude through various sensors (in contrast, GPS only locates position without pose** **and attitude). Visual SLAM is a branch of SLAM that mainly relies on cameras for positioning, and is the core technology of AR/VR.**

**The handsome Jakob in the picture above is the author of DSO (Direct Sparse Odometry), the pioneering work of \[Sparse Direct Method\] SLAM, and now he is the chief scientist of META of All In Metaverse. Because of his position, combined with the research of other XR manufacturers, the conclusion, which is** **the title of this article,** **is reached——XR manufacturers prefer the direct method SLAM to the feature point method SLAM for positioning algorithms.**

**Visual SLAM is a rather complex system with countless technical genres. However, according to the simple classification of the tracking target, that is, the front end, it can be divided into \[feature point method\] and \[direct method\]. The former tracks the corner points that have been paired between frames, and the latter tracks points with the same pixel value between frames. The direct method is also the backbone of our Stereo2 algorithm.**

**In fact, the author of Raul Mur-Artal--ORB-SLAM,** **who carried forward the feature point method,** **is also in META. But now that Jakob is the chief scientist, it seems to confirm my point.(In fact, the two people who work together today even used to compete with each other in their early papers on the merits of the two approaches, even when they were young，haha）**

&#x200B;

  

**It is precisely because the direct method has fewer corner point extraction and matching cost**  **sources than the feature point method, it has a better chance of achieving a higher frame rate and lower latency. At the same time, because the direct method retains more point information, the tracking is more robust, which is just in line with the needs of the XR industry and the autonomous driving industry.**

&#x200B;

[Application of Direct Method in META's Automated Driving Scenario](https://preview.redd.it/lognd4s4nc6b1.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2addb87429e0e11ebf231b870b4d300a23883f8)

**In addition to the advantages of robustness and cost , the semi-dense point cloud generated by the direct method can better describe our three-dimensional world——compared to the embarrassingly useless sparse point cloud of the feature point method.** 

 

[Point cloud generated by direct method](https://preview.redd.it/cgq6k9i8nc6b1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8c192bc5c5f1681cc635567deff0a9c81c678ca)

**Of course, the feature point method also has its advantages. For example, when the tracking is not lost, the accuracy is often slightly better than the direct method. In addition, its low requirements for cameras and images are also one of the reasons why it is more popular with beginners.**

**In recent years, we have found that beginners seem to prefer the feature point method, or to put it bluntly, prefer ORB-SLAM. The reasons are very complicated, but I think the main reason is that the code of ORB-SLAM is so elegant, concise and very friendly to beginners. In contrast, the representative work of the direct method, the code of DSO is...well,** **hard to describe.**

As you raise and lower the camera, the wire going  to the computer would continuously spin and get bound up, so I  installed one of these slip rings, with a basic unshielded rj45 on each  end: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NW9PT4P/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_search\_asin\_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NW9PT4P/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
5. after  the slip ring, one end is coupled into a short length of the above cat7  cable (this has basic unshielded connectors as well) This cable is  plugged in to the other block of the USB to ethernet conversion system,  which is plugged into a laptop and is also fed from an external power  supply plugged into an outlet.
6. when the camera is switched on, all things perfect, the stream is visible through corresponding software on the laptop.

I  have tested this system several times and it works. I have used cheaper  USB-over-ethernet systems that worked but would not supply power to the  camera as it was running, so the cable could not be permenantly  installed. I upgraded to the system above, tested it on the bench, and  it worked great. Tested it 10+ times to make sure over the next week,  and left it running for hours with no problem while spinning the  spool/slip ring to see if it fails.

Yesterday  I finally got the PVC caps I need and had the time to drill the holes  to take the USB and ethernet cables. When I got home that night, the  camera worked, but was intermittent and failed after a few seconds. I  kept trying, and eventually it would not work at all.

So, I started testing the individual links of the chain. I can separate the cables into:

1. from camera to end of spool - 1 end unshielded, 1 end factory 115 ft
2. slip ring, unshielded rj45 on each end - so essentially a short ethernet cable
3. from the slip ring to the topside USB over Ethernet - unshielded rj45 on each end 8 ft

the three of these together do not work. They worked a few days ago for hours of testing.

pick any two, and put couplers between them, and it works perfectly for hours. WTF.

I've  tested all of them individually and in different pairs and it works  every time. But it doesn't work with all three! I've tried replacing all  the connectors at least once.

so, questions.

1. is  it important to maintain shielding? I have heard shielding is  unnecessary unless your run is by power cables, which this is not; but  it is carrying a small power charge because it is able to charge the  camera 115 ft away. Should I try replacing all my connections with  shielded rj45s?
2. Could  this be a problem with interference? I can't think of a reason why any 2  of those three cables would work but not all three. all three must be  putting me over some kind of threshold.
3. The wires on the slip ring[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NW9PT4P/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_search\_asin\_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NW9PT4P/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) say ""silver plated teflon"" this sounds terrible, should I upgrade to a better one? I originally ordered [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NCL3SY3/ref=ewc\_pr\_img\_1?smid=AP724HR1I0JHQ&th=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NCL3SY3/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=AP724HR1I0JHQ&th=1)  before I switched to that other one. could the slip ring be adding  extra resistance that only becomes a problem with all three sections?

I appreciate any help you can give me, I'll be putting this in a few different subs in hopes of finding a friendly genius.

Thanks!",1686949727.0

"[ROBOTSTUDIO ]Possible to compare current position to routine, flag bool as TRUE if it matches a robtarget within the routine?",1,14anlp3,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/14anlp3/robotstudio_possible_to_compare_current_position/,1," 

I'm using RobotStudio to write an auto-recovery program for a Multimove IRC5 controller, beginning with Robot 1. The goal is to avoid having to manually jog the robots Home during an error state, instead simply selecting PP to Main.

My process is as follows:

The Main program checks if doHome\_R1=0.

If R1 is NOT at Home, the program will check a series of Boolean flags, each mapped to various positions the robot might be in.

For example, if R1 is in Pos1, then bFlag1=TRUE and R1 homes from Pos1; if R1 is in Pos2, then bFlag2=TRUE and R1 homes from Pos2, etc.

If R1 is NOT at Home and no flag is true, the teach pendant sends a message that the robot is in an unknown position and must be jogged manually.

Is it possible to compare R1's current position to a specific routine and, if it matches a robtarget within the routine, makes the flag TRUE?

Or is that impossible after PP to Main?

I want to avoid writing something messy like this:

PROC PosCheck\_R1()

VAR bool bFlag1;

VAR robtarget rTemp;

ConfL\\On;

ConfJ\\ON;

rTemp:=CRobT(\\TaskRef:=T\_ROB1Id\\Tool:=tR1Current\\WObj:=wobj\_R1);

Motor/gear/controller combinations with specs similar to cordless drills?,6,149l73l,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/149l73l/motorgearcontroller_combinations_with_specs/,4,"In similar price ranges, the specs for general purpose motor/gear box/controller combinations are so much lower than for drills it's insane. Looking at brushless options the desparity is even greater, even cheap-ish imports are five to ten times the price of a decent drill with 1/5 the power. Granted, most have encoders and a convenient interface like i2c, but those components are not that expensive, even compared to the other parts in the controller (mostly MOSFETs), let alone compared to the motor and gears.

Is there a world of motors I've searched for for hours multiple times and failed to discover, do I need to make these myself, or am I just overlooking some reason you can't make such systems- unless they are in a cheap hand held drill, where it magically becomes easy?",1686781800.0

I can get my systems to work perfectly on the bench. e.g.  battery - switch - pi - button - motor controller - motor & motor's battery.  

What I am lacking is the easy, robust and cheapish stuff to make robot bodies out of.  I have used hard plastic, cardboard, string & whatever is laying around (e.g. parts of a toy car) to build robots, but they always feel very shaky, the connections are spotty and look like a Frankenstein monster.  

What would you recommend as a material to build better robots from?  Car, claw, crane are the next few projects.  

I was thinking about lego, kinetx, or punched angle aluminum.  

My tools include a screw drivers, allen wrench, glue & pliers.

QR codes help a lot, but doing high speed tracking against QR codes is still very difficult. So I had a shower thought the other day that we can make it even simpler by using circular barcodes.

I wrote an interactive notebook to explore the maths a bit, and indeed, a given scan line through the center, the distortion you expect from perspective geometry effects is only 3 dimensional. One is a linear translation dimention, so you only have to discover a fit onto 2 non-linear dimension. So I am pretty sure this is a good direction to go to unlock high speed optical tracking.

[https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/circular-barcode-simulator](https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/circular-barcode-simulator)

The consequence of this is you can have an estimate of position without reading the whole camera sensor (very low latency). Also the problem is simplified so much you don't need to search for a good-fit much (low CPU, high rate). So I am hoping to put integrate this inline with something like the 600FPS raspiraw (raspberry PI camera) work.

Good idea? Does anyone have any other ideas where this would fit? I am looking for people in Berlin to work with on the hardware (for fun, this is not serious)",1686413093.0

# [Jun 10th & 11th - The 3rd (and final???) Reddit Robotics Showcase!](https://imgur.com/69vLl7w)



During the 2020 pandemic, members of the reddit & discord r/robotics community rallied to organize an online showcase for members of our community. What was originally envisioned as a small, intimate afternoon video call turned out to be a two day event of participants from across the world. The 2021 and 2022 events showcased a multitude of fantastic projects from the r/Robotics Reddit community, as well as academia and industry.

These events are only made possible by the enthusiasm we’ve had from our community, and we intend on continuing to provide a unique opportunity for roboticists around the world to share and discuss their work, regardless of age or ability.

I am also using a fsi a10b receiver with a 1500mAh 3S 11.1V 100C battery.

So the problem - the weapon esc has a switch, to turn the weapon motor and esc on and off. When it is turned on, the drive motors work perfectly, as expected. But when I flip the switch on, the drive motors cutout, and twitch periodically, but the weapon works as expected. 

I have tried fixing it with using seperate batteries for the weapon and drive, but the issue still persists. What can I do to fix this - any help would be accepted.

One of the main features is to ensure that the hand won't do excessive pressure on the screen to break it. to make this I had the idea of attaching some sort of a sensor that detects the force resulted by the press of the hand and if it exceeds a certain threshhold (yet to be looked at and defined) the hand will be stopped no matter what.   
after some research I found out that a good sensor to be used in this case is Force-sensitive resistor (FSR). But I don't know if it will do the job when attached on the tip of a pen-like hand.   
Can you please confirm if this sensor will do the job or recommend sensors that may help solving my issue.

5. Powered the Raspberry Pi 3B+ using 5V 2.5A (10,000mAh) power bank
6. Wired control signals from RPi to motor drivers
7. Wrote Python code for six types of movements (ROS framework is not used yet)
   1. Forward and backward
   2. Moving right and left horizontally
   3. Rotating clockwise and anti-clockwise
   4. Moving diagonally in 4 directions
   5. Pivot right and left
   6. Pivot right and left sideways

**PROBLEMS FACED**

Raspberry Pi disconnects from WiFi after 5-15 mins. I turned off power management using the following command `sudo iwconfig wlan0 power off` but, the problem exists **\[NOT SOLVED\]**

**RESOURCES USED**

I watched videos on tips for tuning and usually they mention to increase P until the bot balances but oscillates a lot. I tried this but no matter the P value I can’t get it to react fast enough. Any tips would be greatly appreciated as I am just a beginner.

Trying to make a spring loaded actuator,3,140e0sv,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/140e0sv/trying_to_make_a_spring_loaded_actuator/,7,"I'm trying to make a spring loaded  actuator. 

Explanation of how it works: The motor (part 1) is used to pull the piston back and cock the piston (motor rotates clockwise), a mechanism is used to hold the piston (part 6) until ready for firing. When the piston is ready to fire the mechanism (part 6) will release letting the piston move to the left under the force from the spring (part 5). 

When the piston is firing I would need to rotate the motor in the opposite direction (anticlockwise) to when the motor is cocking the piston (clockwise) so that there is slack in the steel wire so there's nothing resisting the spring. I could do this using a bi-directional ESC. 

I already have a uni-directional ESC so I can cock the piston. I was just curious, is there a way of making this work (providing the slack in the steel wire) without the use of a bi-directional ESC (some sort of mechanism to detach the steel wire from the motor then attach it again). 

The reason why I need the motor to spin anticlockwise and can't just have the motor be off is because this will still have quite a lot of friction.

Considering this, I'm torn between using an Arduino or a Raspberry Pi.

Don’t use print statements to Debug your ROS nodes.,33,13ybcf4,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/13ybcf4/dont_use_print_statements_to_debug_your_ros_nodes/,29,"
Hello New 🐝 ! 🤖 

I wanted to share a tip that might seem obvious to some, but can be a game changer for those who aren't already doing it: **Stop using print statements to debug your ROS nodes. Use a debugger instead!**

Why? Debuggers provide a more in-depth and interactive way to inspect your code compared to print statements. Here's what a debugger can offer:

1. **Pause execution:** Debuggers allow you to stop your program mid-execution at specified breakpoints. This lets you inspect the state of your code at any point, and step through your code one line at a time.

2. **Inspect variables:** You can look at the current value of any variable or expression at any point in your program. This is much more flexible than print debugging, where you're limited to the information you decided to print out when you ran the program.

3. **Control execution:** Debuggers let you execute your program one line at a time, and also allow you to step in (execute a function and then step into it to continue line-by-line execution there) or step out (finish executing the current function and go back to the calling function).

For those using VS-Code with the ROS extension, setting up the debugger is quite straightforward. The instructions for setting it up can be found [here](https://github.com/ms-iot/vscode-ros/blob/master/doc/debug-support.md). Once you've set it up, you'll have a much more powerful and flexible tool at your disposal. This can significantly ease the process of tracking down and fixing bugs in your ROS nodes.

Happy debugging! 🐞🔨

And here's a question to kickstart the discussion: **What's your experience with using debuggers in your ROS development? Do you have any additional tips, best practices, or favorite debugger features that have made your life easier?** Looking forward to hearing your insights and starting a great conversation!",1685708898.0
Frustration with NEMA stepper driver,2,13yudvw,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/13yudvw/frustration_with_nema_stepper_driver/,1,"Hi friends, this is my first time working with NEMA stepper motors, and I am frustrated with getting the driver to work.  I have bought a couple different drivers such as this one:  
[https://www.omc-stepperonline.com/digital-stepper-driver-1-0-4-2a-20-50vdc-for-nema-17-23-24-stepper-motor-dm542t](https://www.omc-stepperonline.com/digital-stepper-driver-1-0-4-2a-20-50vdc-for-nema-17-23-24-stepper-motor-dm542t)

Hopefully I am just dumb about stepper motors and my problem has a boneheaded answer, but my googling has not turned up anything.

There seem to be a few different very similar models on Amazon.  I apologize I cannot attach my circuit diagram, but I have hooked this up in a pretty standard way: I've left ENA disconnected, and am driving PUL+ using a 3.3V 100Hz pulse train, level shifted up to 5V.  PUL-, DIR+ and DIR- are grounded. 

24VDC is connected to the electronics ground and the +/- inputs.

I am seeing two weird things:

1) When disconnected, the level shifter is outputting 5V pulses.  When I connect it to PUL+, it immediately drives the pulse amplitude down to 3.5ish volts.  I put a 10k pull up resistor on it and it still happened.  The D542T is supposed to be driven by 5V I'm pretty sure.  Is PUL+ drawing too much current maybe?  Guess I should try measuring that.

2) The other strange thing is that, if I look at e.g. A+ vs ground, it outputs a constant 20 Hz at about 13V, even with PUL+ and PUL- disconnected.  Based on my (very limtied) understanding of stepper motors, I would expect this value to be some fraction of the input pulse frequency.  Does this driver use some sort of PWM?  In any case, whatever is coming out of the driver, it is not driving my motor.  I have tried to double check that the pinouts of the motor match my wiring, but it appears that there may be two different pinout configurations for NEMA coils with the same color wires and/or 4-pin connector.  The 20 kHz frequency and amplitude seem unaffected by whatever I put into the driver.

Anyway, the motor isn't moving.  It just sits there vibrating a little bit.  Any advice would be welcome!  I would really like to just drive a high power stepper motor simply, I've got twin six year olds and not a lot of time.",1685750961.0

Role of the following in robotics: Distinguishing whether a change in sensory stimulus is due to a change in the environment vs the movement of the robot,3,13yku55,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/13yku55/role_of_the_following_in_robotics_distinguishing/,3,"I'm reading [The Evolution of the Sensitive Soul by Simona Ginsburg and Eva Jablonka](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262039307/the-evolution-of-the-sensitive-soul/), and in its 6th chapter, the authors explore the idea that one of the basic functions that the biological nervous systems might have had is to (i) coordinate the muscles (ii) detect if a change in sensations that the organism receives from its environment was due to movement initiated by the organism itself or due to a change in the environment itself.

I am currently completing a masters in cognitive science, and during this period I had also come across the notion of stability in visual perception: even though our eyes as well as our head and body move about constantly, and the stimulus we receive on our retina changes rapidly, yet our experience is that of a stable world. And not just the experience, but even our actions are as if somewhere in our brains, the effect of self-directed motion gets subtracted from the change in visual perception. This breaks down if the stimulus changes in ways we are not used to, for example, a method I had come across involved pushing our eyeball slightly to see the effect it has (at least) on our first person experience of the change in our environment. Or at least, those are my interpretations of the claims.

Coming to robotics, or artificial intelligence more generally, I wanted to know if the above has any practical significance. As in, is dealing with the above distinction a regular part of working in robotics? If so, could you point to the relevant terminologies (so I can google them once I know the terms) or even the relevant research, applications, and open questions pertaining to this? Or may be if the above distinction is irrelevant, would you recommend anything that discusses the above issues in the context of robotics?",1685731032.0

In my experience of building humanoid robots, I've found several mathematical concepts to be invaluable. It's like learning the language of your robot, a key to truly understanding and improving your creation. I wanted to share these concepts with you and hear about your experiences.

1. **Trigonometry**: Trigonometry is like our robot's gym coach, making sure every step and movement is perfectly angled. It's essential for the movement of robotic arms and legs.
2. **Linear Algebra**: This is like the robot's internal GPS, helping it know where its hand is relative to its body, or how to adjust its head to look at you when you call its name.
3. **Calculus**: Calculus helps our robots understand how things change and evolve, like predicting where a ball will land so the robot can catch it.
4. **Differential Equations**: They're our robot's strategy guide to how things will play out based on different conditions, like how quickly it can stop or start moving.
5. **Probability and Statistics**: They're the safety goggles for our robots, dealing with uncertainty and helping estimate their position within a map.
6. **Graph Theory**: It's like our robot's hiking guide, helping them plan the best path from point A to point B.
7. **Geometry**: Geometry is the eyes of our robot, crucial for vision systems for object detection and recognition.
8. **Quaternion Algebra**: Quaternion Algebra keeps our robots balanced, helping them accurately calculate and control orientation in space, preventing problems like gimbal lock.

Now, I'm curious to hear your stories! What mathematical concepts have proven crucial in your robotics journey? How have these ideas come to life in your creations? Have you discovered other mathematical concepts that others might find surprising or helpful?

Do self driving cars rely completely on deep learning to make decisions?,10,13vqe6y,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/13vqe6y/do_self_driving_cars_rely_completely_on_deep/,14,"Self driving cars, as far as I have read, use highly refined vision algorithms for mapping and localization and then further use deep learning for planning. My question is, how are we supposed to trust a relatively large machine with no concept of stability and robustness. I have read several papers on reinforcement learning algorithms solving problems ranging from simple to highly complex non linear systems. But here is the carch, these algorithms lack is formal verification. What I mean is that these algorithms have almost no concept of robustness and stability.

Now coming to the question, self driving cars also rely completely on these learning algorithms. How can we trust that these cars will always behave according to our plan? Is there something behind the scenes which guarantees the optimality that I'm not aware of?",1685453411.0

What would be the efficiency of dielectric elastomers if these were made with copper wire instead?,3,13vwcth,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/13vwcth/what_would_be_the_efficiency_of_dielectric/,1,"So, no matter how much I search, there isn't any kind of artificial muscle that even reaches the efficiency of electric motors (above 90%).

Even carbon nanotubes and graphene soft actuators can't even reach 2% of efficiency (as far the articles I read that actually tell its efficiency).

So, I just stumbled upon Dielectric Elastomers, which are considered an promising option, but I can't find an elastomer that can even reach such efficiencies. The most efficient that I heard about was an specific type of Dielectric Elastomer that the ""ChatGPT"" of Quora suggested that it has 42% of efficiency:  ""[A processable, high-performance dielectric elastomer and multilayering process](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn0099)"" .

In anyway, I found this helical Dielectric Elastomer, which is basically a spiral tape with the positive side on the top part and the negative side on the bottom part, since it is an spiral, the top half will always be attracted to the bottom half: ""[Force optimization and numerical validation of helical dielectric elastomer actuator](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331725568_Force_optimization_and_numerical_validation_of_helical_dielectric_elastomer_actuator)"".

By replacing the conductive coating for actual copper wiring, how much efficient would this system be?

Or it would only work with copper wiring if thes spirals where covered into small copper coils like electromagnets?",1685467482.0

My main question is there anything that I could do that isn't already sufficiently covered in the Apriltag preprocessing algorithm that's built into the detector? Using some thresholding and mask fill techniques I'm able to clean up the input image a good bit to make it look more like a normal tag but it hasn't been enough to get consistent detections.

We are using a Nema 17 65Ncm bipolar stepper motor connected to a spur gear system using a 16 tooth gear and 80 tooth gear that should produce enough torque to rotate the ""arm"" of the robot upwards from 0-90 degrees. The amount of torque needed is 235Ncm, so I assumed this would work, but the motor is unable to lift up the arm. We have tested the code for the motor when it was not connected to the arm and it rotates sufficiently.

Is the motor itself just too small for the application? We are considering swapping out the spur gears for helical gears, or potentially metal ones as they are currently 3D printed (not sure if that would actually make a difference).

If anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated :)

I have built a lot of robots which can carry a max of 3-5 kg. Now I want to build a robot that can pull a person with robot size of 800mm x 500mm. Can you suggest a good motor with this capacity? The robot weight will be approx. 35KG. Over this, it should be able to pull 70kg. 

Some of the options I have checked are high torque planetary gear motors (200RPM, 3Nm), Wheel Chair Motor (150RPM, 11Nm, Costly).

When I used 'roslaunch fourwheelbot model.launch' (fourwheelbot -  name of the package, model.launch - launch file), it is displaying a  different model, some pre-built model present in the gazebo library.

I'm working on a project and im struggling to design the circuit for it.

Essentially I have a logic input. If this input is high for longer than 1s it will switch something on (say an led). Once 5s have elapsed with the input signal being low the output should reset back to zero (led is off). It should remain off as default unless the logical input is high again for longer than 1s.

Im using 555 timing chip for working out both time delays, and some logic chips. I think i might also need a latch/flipflop.

Can anyone break down how I can approach this problem and what the circuit would look like, or point me in the direction of videos/articles that can help with this.

I know Boston Dynamic’s Atlas is the most impressive robot we have to date that has achieved some level of mobility similar to what humans can do but it is still at least half as mobile than a human in terms of actual movement agility like sprinting and making fast turns or pivots in motion, it has nowhere near the dexterity of a real human. It has just very good balance and body control which enables it to do cool feats like backflips, but thats it.

The reason i am asking is because im wondering if im missing something? Are they actually trying to achieve the results im proposing or are they not even trying to do that? Why not? Because to me, it would actually seem extremely obvious why they have yet to succeed at it from my understanding although i am no robotics expert nor would i myself be able to do the engineering but i see a glaringly obvious flaw that all bipedal robots have that no one seems to be focused on which would achieve the ability for robots to move like humans, in theory. Is it because they purposely want to limit the mobility of robots so we dont get terminators?

Because if i had the funding i would start my own robotics company and focus on this singular thing and i think i would be able to achieve the goal which no company has so far because every one so far is looking at it from a critically flawed standpoint imo.

Emo Desktop Pet Clone [Help],40,13noykp,robotics,https://i.redd.it/8ucotafz871b1.png,2,"Hi guys, after completing my first two link robot arm. I wanted to explore more of such projects. 
I started with looking for projects and came across this emo Desktop Pet robot. I like it's walking style and thought to give it a short. I've modelled and 3d printed (as you can see in the picture).

I'm stuck at coding phase. I want to code it in such way that on every iteration of `loop()` it moves gradually. For example if I want to draw a circle on screen/canvas I gradually increase the angle then calculate x,y to draw a point on circle's circumference. Similarly I want to do the same because suppose in between the robot receives command to stop in between it's walking cycle it should continue from where it's current position is at move to stop or rest position.  

How can I achieve this? Please send me some articles or reference.
And also I'm just hardcoding the movements of each servo I'm not using kinematics here. How can I use kinematics here? Because I'm seeing the emo's walk cycle carefully all of the servos doesn't move, first the foot servo moves and lifts it up and top servos moves it front. I also wanted to know whether it's hard-coded movement or whether they just provide x,y co-ordinate and then the robot/algorithm calculates how to move each servo. Please let me know waiting eagerly for solutions 🥺. 

Thanks in advance 🙂

The [Augmentation Lab](http://augmentationlab.org/incubator) is a **full-time hacker lab** founded by two Harvard students to extend human capabilities & improve the human condition. For 10 weeks, **6-10 creative technologists will live and work together** to build the next impactful technologies in the fields of wearable computing, robotics, AR/VR, BCIs, and AI/ML. With mentorship from renowned experts, the residency will integrate hardware and software engineering, product development, scientific methods, and creative storytelling to produce foundational innovations backed by rigorous research. We will self-experiment our technologies and our experiences will be recorded in a documentary.

Past projects of the hacker lab include eye-gaze-controlled supernumerary robotic limbs, NLP-driven XR game engines, and haptic gloves that reinvent IoT interactions. Our work explores transhumanism, cognitive augmentation, physical augmentation, & immersive worlds through research, engineering, and creative practices.

We are looking for **creative builders**, particularly those with hardware experience (yet we still welcome applications from software engineers) who share a deep interest in extending human capabilities.

Pc vs laptop,0,13kxfb6,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/13kxfb6/pc_vs_laptop/,4,"Hi I'm a prospective robotics msc at delft, and was thinking to upgrade my already existing laptop as it i behaves very strangely/has little ram and no graphics card. 
I was stuck between choosing a pc or a laptop. I was wondering if anyone knew how computationally expensive university courseworks could be in Robotics, and therefore if they could suggest me to get a good pc or  if a laptop could suffice. Mind you if I had a pc I would still keep my laptop for when i go to the library, however it isn't so reliable for very computationally heavy code..

Thanks you in advance :)",1684412092.0

Sanctuary AI revealed Phoenix yesterday. Here are the features presented on their website: 

**Phoenix features:**

* Human-like form and function: standing at 5’ 7” (+- 170 cm) and weighing 155 lbs (+- 70 kg)
* Maximum payload of 55 lbs (+- 25 kg) 
* Maximum speed of 3 miles per hour (+- 4.8 km per hour)
* Industry-leading robotic hands with 20 degrees of freedom that rival human hand dexterity and fine manipulation with proprietary haptic technology that mimics the sense of touch
* Improved aesthetics with a bolder color palette and elevated textures.  


**Carbon features:**

* A cognitive architecture and software platform for humanoid general-purpose robots
* Integrates modern AI technologies to translate natural language into action in the real world
* Enables Phoenix to think and act to complete tasks like a person
* Explainable and auditable reasoning, task, and motion plans
* Symbolic and logical reasoning coupled with modern LLMs (for general knowledge), domain-specific integrations, and extensions
* Agency and goal-seeking behaviors
* Uses Deep Learning & Reinforcement Learning
* Photo-realistic and physics-realistic world simulations for robot training
* Human-in-the-loop supervision, teleoperation, and fleet management

What are your thoughts on Phoenix? Revolutionary or still far from optimal?",1684333916.0

Pseudo Jacobian Matrix near Singularity,2,13kin7t,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/13kin7t/pseudo_jacobian_matrix_near_singularity/,2,"Hi,

I developed an inverse kinematic solver based on the pseudo Jacobian method for a 4-degree-of-freedom (DoF) robot. The task space of the robot is defined by four parameters: (x, y, z, and theta), where theta represents the rotation around the y-axis. When I applied the solver to compute the inverse kinematics for a desired task space change of (0.1, 0, 0, 0), it provided the corresponding changes in joint angles (qs\_changes).

To address the issue of jerky movements near singularities, I incorporated the damped least squares method into the solver. This technique helps smooth out the robot's motion when it approaches singular configurations. However, I found that while the jerky movements have been successfully eliminated, the computed qs\_changes near the singularity no longer achieve the desired task space change of (0.1, 0, 0, 0). Are you aware of any papers that address/ explain this issue?",1684368288.0

The first I wanted to do was to create a small vehicle with a bit of power that could patrol my house while I am out or sleeping. The car should be autonomous but also be overridden manually in order to be controller as an RC car with some intelligence (for example obstacle avoidance, return to home functionality or auto charging as robot vacuums do). I wanted the vehicle to be suitable to ride small rocks or obstacles on its way and be waterproof. It should also have FPV capability or on a later version multi-camera views, lights and maybe a siren. 

So I started slow, I dissassembled an old RC I had with tracks, removed the main PCB and installed a motor controller which I quickly burned down. Now I have an L298N. I also connected a FlySky controller with iBus to a Raspberry pi pico. Last, I added an HCSR04 supersonic sensor on the front and started working with an auto-braking  system while driving the car with the RC controller towards an object. 

I am almost there. But I am also completely lost at this phase and I could use some help or guidance. 

Should I replace my raspberry pico with a raspberry pi zero to easily control the GPIO Pins, add openCV capability or maybe an oled ? Some are easily configured in the pico but it has limited memory capacity and Thonny isn't the best tool to work. 

Last about the chassis. **Please** advice. I saw some kits in banggood but also I have a lot of tools and I am a DIY enthusiast but I am far from designing a car metal chassis. But I really want to and I could try at least to create my ""simple box with wheels"" chassis as a Version 2 of my robot. I am running out of space in my old RC and it's plastic so it has a limited life as a version 1.

They work on current as far as I know, but what value should I be looking after in the datasheet? For MOSFETs, it's their Vgs

I'm really afraid transistors will use too much current, since as far as I know the MAX current RPi Pico GPIOS can provide is 16 mA (and 50mA for all in total), which is extremely small! What value should I be looking after in the transistors datasheets to know how many I can use? If they all draw a couple of miliamps then it means we can use just barely a few of them, which would be extremely unpractical!

For the purpose of why I wanted to use transistors, is because I'm working on a project where the gate voltage of my MOSFETs are too high for the tiny 3.3V the Pi can give, so I will supply them using a MOSFET commanded through PWM by the Pi.",1684269213.0

Python Virtual Robot Controller,5,13hlrjm,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/13hlrjm/python_virtual_robot_controller/,0,"Below listed is the Python code for a work-in-progress control software that goes to a robot project of mine.

This program uses the Turtle module to create a graphical representation of the robot, its environment, and other sensor information. The program uses the keyboard module to receive input and execute actions based on this control. Once I finish the actual build for the robot, I will update this program to wirelessly send commands and receive data from the robot. 

In the meantime, does anyone have advice or input on how to make the animation smoother or what other features should be integrated into this virtual controller?

Controls: 'W' - forward; 'S' - backward; 'L' - left; 'R' - right; 'space' - stop robot; 'z' and 'x' open and close grabber arm; 'up arrow' and 'down arrow' raise and lower arm; 'esc' to terminate connection.

12V power wheels battery for my fathers robot (he is not careful with batteries),3,13hmcfa,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/13hmcfa/12v_power_wheels_battery_for_my_fathers_robot_he/,7,"TL:DR - Is using the power tools adapter (like they use on the kids power wheels cars) a good battery solution for my old man that I am hesitant to trust using a Li Ion pack. If you have a better solution it would be appreciated. 

I will try and keep it short and simple. I have made a robot/ tank for my dad to use to go under houses. I am trying to think of the best, and least likely to start a fire, solution for the battery. For testing this robot I have used a 3S Li Ion that I wired up a while back for a drone. It works great. I have considered sticking that in there, but him having to take the battery out each time and put it on a balance charger and all is a pain and I doubt he would want to do it. Also, a 3S battery pack without a BMS is sketchy, especially when its him that is dealing with it. 

My main theory as of now, is to use those 12v power wheel adapters and use like a Milwaukie battery pack with it. My thinking is I can just stick the adapter on the top of the robot and he can easily remove batteries and charge them, while being safer. In my mind this is the best mix of easy and safe ish. There is already chargers for those batteries that are pretty easy and usually they have some protections built in. Makes me feel much more comfortable that just a 3S li ion pack sitting in the enclosure over time. 

I would really appreciate any opinions here, mainly I am looking to see if anyone thinks this is a bad idea. If you guys think I should maybe go another route. Also, I don't have any experience with these power tool adapters, so I would think if anyone would when it comes to robotics you guys would. 

Thanks so much, I appreciate any feedback.",1684095902.0
Recommended E-Stop solutions for mobile robots,1,13hti8a,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/13hti8a/recommended_estop_solutions_for_mobile_robots/,5,"Hey all!

I'm currently working on a mobile robotics platform and we're integrating some high power systems that could potentially be dangerous if something goes really wrong.  To that end, I'd like to setup some kind of e-stop protection circuit and was wondering what a good approach for that generally is.  The system can draw up to 220A peak (24VDC) so I need to find something that can support a lot of current going through it.  Do you have any suggestions for where to start?  Thanks!",1684113948.0

Vr Force feedback system,4,13hd1uy,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/13hd1uy/vr_force_feedback_system/,4,"I am struggling to figure out what is the best motor for the application I'm thinking of.

I'm planning to design vr joint force feedback system using tendon like system connected to a motor drive. So for the elbow, a single motor would pull in either direction, opening and closing the joint. So if holding an object of a certain weight, the system should pull the arm straight with a torque matching the weight of the object. 

In practice the user should resist this force when holding or moving objects. My concern is how this will affect the motor when acting against the direction it is trying to pull. This is basically the same as force feedback steering wheels where the user turns against the direction of the motor. However ideally I would like to use smaller motors which would require a reduction to get appropriate torque, but when resisting the pull of the motor and lifting objects, this would cause the motor to be spun in the opposite direction at high speeds whilst trying to act in the opposite directions and I'm not sure that would work and would just break the motor.

Is this just a case of finding an appropriate motor driver which will protect the motor? Clearly something like this is possible as the motors in the steering wheel systems have reductions using brushed dc motors.

Any help is greatly appreciated!",1684072931.0

That was around 6 weeks ago, Arduino Mega and Uno kit for my overall interest in circuits. Toyed with that for around 3 weeks and really enjoyed it, my fatal flaw reared its ugly head though, said this isn't hard enough lets go deeper. I now have an Arduino robot car from elegoo (V4) and had fun assembling that, I really want to build a hexapod though (probably cliche by now) they fascinate me though, and with my 3d printing and interest in hardware, in general, it seemed to fit.

I find my issue though I really just don't have the coding experience to just dive in, nor any info on kinematics, walking gaits etc... My interest still prevails though, ultimately I am curious about some others' journeys into this. I didn't have the chance to really dive into this younger (My school labeled me with some learning disability ILP or something, essentially I struggle with some pattern recognition and memorization) but I really feel I have sparked a passion for something here.

im building a hexapod for uni, and im trying to choose a good servo for my project

im having some trouble calculating how much torque do i need for the robot

my requierements are that the robot is able to carry 5kg, the robot shouldnt weight more than 3 kg itself.

the body size is 60cm by 70cm

im including a quick scetch i made showing the anatomy of a leg

EDIT: i didnt mark the location of servos: s1 on the connection of first leg segment and body, you can see the rest

so far from my calculations i found that if i want the robot to walk by lifting 3 legs (r1, r3 and l2) i need almost 10 nm of torque

did i make a mistake or do i actually need that big of a servo

thanks a lot

I'm working on a project for an introductory reinforcement learning class, where I'm using Q-learning to control a simulated mobile robot. The robot needs to navigate to different areas as if it were a waiter, but I'm struggling to figure out how to make it recognize when it's in the correct ""table"" area.

I'm not very familiar with mobile robotics or image processing, so I had the idea to use black and white stripes on the floor to signal to the robot when it's reached the correct area. For example, if the robot is at Table 1, the stripes would be arranged as WBW, and for Table 2, the stripes would be WBWBW.

However, I haven't been able to find an algorithm to ""read"" these stripes. Is this a good approach, or is there a better way to solve this problem? Also, since I need to use the stripe information as input for the Q-learning algorithm, is there any code out there that I can use to get started?

I would believe there to be a large market for such a robot. I wonder why even after two years no company seems to have turned this idea into a product. With hardware and low-level grasping being dealt with by Boston Dynamics I don’t see how it would take more than two years to build a first version given enough financing. As they describe themselves in the article one needs to build a machine learning model to identify litter and use the grasping API to collect it. Lastly a sweeping algorithm would need to be implemented that tells Spot where to look.  Some practical problems also require thought such as how to deal with vandalism and charging Spot. However, I would’ve expected a company would have released a first version after two years.

Is there anyone here that knows to make sense of this? Are there open problems in robotics research that are a barrier?

I know dexterous manipulation is still an open problem with the annual real robot challenge being hosted by the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems every year. However, a trash collecting would only require grasping capabilities and simple manipulation (put grasped trash in the bin it’s carrying on its back).

What motors would you use to get:

* precise motion (point the clock hands to a given angle)
* repeatable motion (no drift over time)
* relatively quiet since there'll be a few dozen motors
* relatively small footprint
* cheap (hopefully a bit under $339,000)

I can create the graph for optimizer - `VertexCam` for each time step, `VertexPointXYZ` for each point I see and link each cam with the points with measurements (cam coordinates) - `EdgeProjectP2MC`. For Now I fix all cameras so the optimizer does not move them and the results are not that bad (reprojection error in order of pixels).

SLAM localization methods?,4,139vr9r,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/139vr9r/slam_localization_methods/,11,"Hey everyone. I am trying to implement SLAM from scratch on a robot. I just got pose estimation working for some fiducials I set up. My next step is to get odometry data from my IMU and start storing my trajectory data. My question is which localization method to use for SLAM? I only have picamera (no lidar) and IMU so I was going to either use FAST for feature detection SLAM, or use a neural net to generate a point cloud, something like NERF but that can run on my laptop. I haven't looked into the final mapping piece too much just yet.

For my question, after doing some reading, I have found that pose graph optimization seems to be the popular way of optimizing your map when performing loop closure. However I am not sure if this can be combined with different methods of monte carlo localization. Like for example, can pose graph slam be used with a particle filter for predicting my position with just the fiducials and IMU data? In that case if I am using particle filter and updating each particle position when I get noisy IMU data, I would need to check for loop closure for each particle right? Then collapse to the distribution that fits when I find loop closure, and update the pose graph to correct for drift? Or are there simpler/better ways out there right now? I wouldn't be opposed to using something like NERF if I can get it to run on my laptop, but I am assuming I would still need to do some filtering on my localization data.

Anyways, it hasn't yet ""clicked"" for me which steps in the pipeline are using what just yet, but as I am getting closer to each milestone I want to start getting a concrete idea of the architecture I am implementing. I have read Probabilistic Robotics and watched a few Stachniss lectures but I am at the stage where I need to be able to draw a flow diagram of how my SLAM is going to work. I was wondering if anyone had any pointers. Thanks!",1683392805.0

Is there a common connector within the industry used to connect servo motors to electrical cabinets that is IP67 rated?

We've dabbled a bit in this area, but typically we allow our customers to handle all of the software-specific use cases for the rovers and focus only on the hardware design, maintenance and service.

We want to ensure this is as useful as possible for entrepreneurs to leverage in the area. We don't know what we don't know, so I'm looking to the community to understand what we should put out. It will be publicly available for anyone to use and leverage.

I created this platform based on the existing TurtleBot3 platform in order to make it easier for people to experiment with deep reinforcement learning for mobile robot navigation and obstacle avoidance.

Currently, the platform includes PyTorch implementations for DQN, DDPG, and TD3. The platform is based on ROS2 and provides multiple facilities such as storing/loading models, recording training output, and visualizing neural network activity.

The system has also been validated on a low-cost physical robot, videos are included in the GitHub readme.

I wanted to share the platform here in the hope that it could be helpful for anyone wanting to experiment with deep reinforcement learning or even implement their own algorithms. Thanks!

In these days I was wondering what is your typical workflow when you program your robot which, in your opinion, boost your productivity. Like for example:

1) What program do you use to write code? (Vs code, EMacs, Vim,…) and most importantly, does it make you more productive because it has some specific features? (Like for example some specific VS code plugins)

2) Do you have some kind of CI/CD for your software? If yes how do you use them? I am kind of confused about how these things should improve your productivity when developing a robot software.

3) Something else i forgot?

Furthermore, do you think that it is necessary that a robotic engineer should know Docker and Kubernetes?

3D point of plane center,2,133r8pu,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/133r8pu/3d_point_of_plane_center/,0,"I have been working on this project for quite awhile now and I just can't get it to work.

Actually, this project is more related to AR but since my question about SLAM is relatively closer to the robotics side, I thought it'd best to post here. Here's my question.

So what I'm trying to do, is to get a 3D point in the real world from a monocular camera (1-lens-camera). What I'm trying to do is to place a 3D object on the specific point and it can't be predetermined. I've done research and ORB-SLAM2 has this nice feature called the **MonoAR** mode. Basically, it's to help people like me to place things on top of a plane. With just a single RGB camera, it can find, what they call, feature points from the real world and place things on top. Of course, the scale will a problem, but it's not a big problem for my project, so it's a perfect fit! Here is a picture of ORB-SLAM2 placing a virtual 3D object on top of a plane.

[ORB-SLAM2 MonoAR mode](https://preview.redd.it/kew5rt2js0xa1.png?width=840&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3dda2c1750e301c6988d9bd8ed1e169db0f7461)

Now, all I need to do is to connect this system with Unity (to place custom 3d object) and place it on the phone. Since this specific feature use ROS, so I've modified the code to publish the data to a ROS topic and send the data to Unity with a Python script. When I combined all the things together, it all worked perfectly, except that the 3D object on the Unity is misaligned with what the ORB-SLAM2 shows. I've been researching on the information I extracted from the plane, below is what I extracted of this specific plane.

What I sent to the Unity is the origin point. I thought the origin meant the plane origin, but from what I've researched I think it's the origin point of the camera. But it kinda make sense, because the 3D object on the Unity is placed around the area where the camera is (or maybe it's just coincidence idk for sure).

Since I'm no expert in SLAM, I have very limited exposure to all this transformation matrices. So instead of working with Unity right away, I thought I should maybe find the formula to get the center of the plane first then send the data to Unity. FYI, ORB-SLAM2 use the right-hand coordinate system and Unity use the left-hand coordinate system (y-axis up).

So I tried to write Python script to find the plane center and display the projected 3D point on the captured frame to check if it's correct. From all the researches and a lot of help from ChatGPT, the best we've come up with is the code below. But it's still waaaay off, the `center_point_image` I got is off the image lol (`[-1.37308541e+03 -5.57313688e+01  1.00000000e+00]`)

Can somebody help? I've been working tirelessly on this for almost 2 weeks now and I desperately need help! I know I'm supposed to ask questions in the ""Weekly Question"" thread, but I think my question is too technical. I'm sorry if I post this wrongly. Please take the post down if I do. Also sorry if I'm not supposed to ask any AR questions.

Anyhow, if anyone is willing to help, please don't worry about the Unity part. Just think of this question as ""how do I project the plane center found with ORB-SLAM2 on an image with Python?"". 

Any help is appreciated! I know it's very long, so here's the TL;DR.

TL;DR:

1. Using ORB-SLAM2 **MonoAR** mode to find plane.
2. I want to place 3D object from the given plane information on Unity.
3. Information of the extracted plane is given above.

Building a TARS-like Robot Inspired by Interstellar – Let's Discuss!,1,132jfyz,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/132jfyz/building_a_tarslike_robot_inspired_by/,12,"I recently re-watched the movie ""Interstellar,"" and I couldn't help but be amazed by the robots in the film, especially TARS and CASE. These silver box-like robots that move back and forth with their arms are so fascinating, and it got me thinking – why not try to build something similar with the current technology we have today?

In the movie, the robots are highly advanced, with exceptional AI, voice, and motor capabilities. I believe that with the advancements in technology we've seen in recent years, we're not far off from making this a reality. Consider Boston Dynamics' robots, for instance. They've already demonstrated impressive mobility and balance. Couple that with state-of-the-art AI and voice technologies, and we could be looking at our very own TARS!

Here's what I'm thinking for a modern-day TARS-like bot:

1. Base it on a versatile robot like those from Boston Dynamics, capable of complex movements and tasks.
2. Incorporate advanced AI algorithms to enable autonomous decision-making, problem-solving, and learning capabilities.
3. Implement AI voice technology for seamless and natural communication with humans. This could include voice changers and creators for added versatility.
4. Design an adaptable mechanical structure that allows the robot to reconfigure its shape and size to navigate various terrains and environments, much like the robots in the movie.

Now, I want to open up the floor to all of you: How do you think we could build a TARS-like bot with the current technology we have? What aspects of AI, voice tech, and robotics do you think are crucial for such a project? I'd love to hear your thoughts, ideas, and suggestions.

Let's create something amazing together!

TL;DR: Inspired by the robots in ""Interstellar,"" I want to discuss how we can build a TARS-like bot using current technology like advanced AI, voice tech, and robots similar to those from Boston Dynamics. Share your ideas and insights!",1682743465.0

I've seen fantastic results using pneumatic muscles, but I don't think we can use an air compressor. The weight limit is 4kg, but I don't think this is a problem as the frog is very small and we can afford carbon plates and generative designed parts.

What I have in mind now is using a motor to drive a gear, the gear will drive a linkage system to extend the leg in a short period of time. Another solution I have in mind is using electric linear actuators to drive the legs (like a pneumatic muscle ), but I have no knowledge about linear actuators and don't know if there are small and fast enough ones.

And what about the controls, we are considering whether to use ROS or not. The frog only needs to complete a single jump as far as possible. This simple action can be controlled by a single-board computer, but we do think using ROS would make our project pop.

I'm thinking of just having it pan and track that - having it pan AND tilt is definitely more challenging but i havent given up yet.  It needs to be quite robust as it will be working 8 hours a day.  My question is this - im thinking of replacing the limit switches with Stallguard stepper motor drivers - this would make it much easier I think? Also if any experienced designer wants to have a look and give us some feedback we would greatly appreciate it. I can provide a solidworks EASM file to view if anyone is interested.

I have recently been looking into robot engineering, since I'm considering creating **cosplays/costumes** in the future and **intergrated electronics** is pretty sought after.   
Mainly moving facial features and tails for anthro customes, as well as mechanical wings and LED installation. I was thinking about speakers and even smoke machines as well.

The problem is just, I can't seem to figure out which education would teach me the skills needed to create those things. Robot engineering seems to be the closest, but I doubt that will teach me to build a tiny smoke machine or a small screen.

Do you guys know if robot engineering is the right field at least for building mechanical limbs that can move? What about a light blinking at random intervals? Is electronics and construction of robot parts even taken into consideration with such an education?

I'm at horrible at math and coding, got autism and probably adhd, have never made a costume in my life, so it's just a thought for now, but I still want to know what my next step would be if I attempted it.

For a while, I've been working on the overall concept of this bot. They do not have a name yet. They are very small and would be capable of resting on someone's shoulder. They (preferably) would act similar to a companion or just a source  of entertainment. 

Any name ideas? Or genuine improvements? I haven't worked on the coding or building yet, since it has been a year or two since I've touched this concept.

Advice on motor control for a wave simulator.,3,12ygwwa,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/12ygwwa/advice_on_motor_control_for_a_wave_simulator/,2,"Hi everyone I have a university model. The idea is to induce wave movement in a glass. Two lead screw rise a platform where another motor slides a platform in the horizontal plane. The combined action of both linear motion create a circle. The motion profile on x and y planes is a sinusoidal motion. We are using steppers motosr of 1.3Nm of stall torque that work allright in the horizontal plane.
 But the vertical one does not work because of the torque load due to the  massive decrease with RPM which should be as high as 3000 RPM.
So basically we need to rise 12 kg at 3000 RPM with two motors using two lead screws in a sinusoidal acceleration profile fairly smoothly. (More or less is 1Nm)
I guess that a DC brushless motor will be allright but i dont know how to control it exactly because my background is not eléctric engineering.
Thanks to everyone I will atach photos.",1682423062.0

How can I implement a Stanley Controller for a Differential Drive?,3,12xuv03,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/12xuv03/how_can_i_implement_a_stanley_controller_for_a/,4,"  

Hello! I am currently trying to program autonomous algorithms for a differential drive base robot, and one of the path tracking algorithms that I researched and really wanted to implement was the Stanley method. However, the Stanley Method is only made for Ackermann steering vehicles (like cars), and I only have a differential drive robot. Is there any way I can implement this?

Currently, what I thought about was converting Ackermann drive kinematics into differential drive kinematics. For example, if the Stanley Controller outputs a steering angle of 30 degrees, I would calculate the speed needed for each side of the differential drive to create the arc made by a car steered 30 degrees. However, I do not know how to do the math for this. 

Any help would be appreciated!",1682367379.0
