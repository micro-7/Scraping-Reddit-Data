A Canadian couple takes their pet polar bear to Antarctica,4,150tt3i,Jokes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/150tt3i/a_canadian_couple_takes_their_pet_polar_bear_to/,0,"Years ago, a couple in Canada found an abandoned polar bear cub and decided to adopt and raise it themselves.  By the time the bear was grown up, it had become very tame, very friendly, and rather jovial.  

Life with a pet polar bear turned out to be pretty fun, but one problem was that taking it on vacations wasn't really an option.  Transportation was a big part of that, of course, but just as big a problem was that few other climates were suitable for polar bears, plus most places obviously did not allow polar bears to walk around.  

However, one day the wife had the interesting, albeit unusual, idea of taking the polar bear to Antarctica.  It seemed ideal, with a suitable temperature and nobody around to tell them not to bring in their pet.  After a hefty dose of crowdfunding, they managed to hire a boat to take them all down to Antarctica.

A week later, they had arrived, and were walking through the barren wilderness of the South Pole.  The couple is excited to see how the bear will take it.  To the chagrin of the wife, though, he just slumps seems to lack a lot of motivation.

""Honey,"" the wife said to her husband. ""I think our poor bear is depressed.  And I don't know why; this is so opposite of how he usually is!""

Harry the horse,4,150vcbt,Jokes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/150vcbt/harry_the_horse/,0,"Once upon a time, in a quaint little village nestled between rolling green hills, there lived a horse named Harry. Now, Harry was no ordinary horse; he possessed an uncanny ability to make the most mundane situations utterly hilarious. His knack for comedy made him the talk of the town, and villagers would eagerly gather whenever Harry was around, hoping for a good laugh.

One sunny morning, as Harry trotted through the village, a peculiar idea struck his mischievous mind. He decided to set off on a grand adventure, a quest to find the funniest joke in the world. With his hooves pounding the ground, Harry embarked on his comedic crusade, determined to bring laughter to every corner of the globe.

His journey took him through dense forests, across vast deserts, and over treacherous mountains. Along the way, he encountered various animals, each with their own unique sense of humor. From witty monkeys to pun-loving parrots, Harry absorbed their jokes like a sponge, honing his comedic skills with every encounter.

Months turned into years, and Harry's fame as the ""Jester of the Animal Kingdom"" spread far and wide. People from distant lands flocked to witness his hilarious antics, and kings and queens bestowed him with honorary titles. Harry, however, remained humble, always searching for that one perfect joke that would make the world burst into laughter.

Finally, after countless adventures and a lifetime of laughter, Harry found himself in a bustling city. The streets were lined with towering buildings, and neon lights flickered in a dizzying display of colors. As he wandered through the lively metropolis, Harry noticed a sign that caught his attention: ""The Hilarious Horse Comedy Club.""

Intrigued, Harry trotted towards the club, the sound of uproarious laughter growing louder with each step. He pushed open the heavy doors and walked into the dimly lit venue. The air buzzed with anticipation, and the audience, a diverse crowd of humans and animals alike, eagerly awaited the show.

Taking center stage, Harry's eyes scanned the room, his heart pounding with excitement. The spotlight illuminated his glistening mane as he launched into a series of side-splitting jokes, each more uproarious than the last. The crowd erupted in raucous laughter, tears streaming down their cheeks.

But amidst the laughter, Harry sensed a pang of emptiness. His quest for the funniest joke had brought him fame and joy, but something was missing. The journey had been long, and Harry began to feel a longing for home, for the simple pleasures of the village where he had first discovered his talent.

With a heavy heart, Harry bid farewell to the cheering audience and made his way back to the village. As he approached the familiar green hills, exhaustion weighed upon him, and his steps grew sluggish. Determined to reach his destination, he plodded on, his hooves dragging through the dirt.

Finally, with the last ounce of energy he could muster, Harry walked into the village's local tavern. The door creaked as he entered, and all eyes turned towards him. The bartender, a stout man with a bushy mustache, took one look at the weary horse and exclaimed, ""Why the long face?""",1689477933.0

The man goes to see god and explains his story, god asks the man “wait, what planet are you from”?  The man replies “Earth”, god says “he’s good, let him through”.

The second muffin chuckled and replied, ""Oh, it's definitely getting a little toasty in this oven. But you know what? It reminds me of a funny story!""

Curiosity piqued, the first muffin leaned in closer, ""Do tell!""

""Well,"" began the second muffin, ""once upon a time, there was a little town called Muffinville. In this delightful place, everyone was a muffin; whether they were chocolate, blueberry, or even banana nut. It was a cozy and flavor-filled town.""

""The muffins in Muffinville were known for being quite adventurous. One day, a group of muffin friends decided to go on a grand baking adventure. They wanted to explore different ovens around the world to see how baking temperatures impacted their recipes. And guess what? They chose our oven first!""

The first muffin's eyes widened with excitement as it thought, ""Oh, this is bound to be a good one!""

""Now, as they made their way into the oven, which closely resembled the one we are in right now,"" continued the second muffin, ""they quickly realized it was getting hotter. The muffins were bouncing around and giggling, trying to adapt to the rising temperature.""

""But things took an unforeseen turn when the oven door suddenly swung open. Startled, the muffins tumbled out onto the kitchen counter. And guess who they found standing there?""

""Who? Who was it?"" the first muffin eagerly asked.

""It was a mischievous little gingerbread man,"" said the second muffin. ""You see, he had been kicked out of the oven by mistake, and he was up to no good, trying to prank the poor muffins.""

""He'd heard them giggling, and his mischievous nature got the better of him. So, when he saw the muffins tumble out, he couldn't resist, and with a sly grin, he asked, 'Is it getting hot in here or is it just me?'""

The first muffin burst into laughter, ""Oh, that gingerbread man sure knew how to play a joke!""

""But wait, here's the best part,"" said the second muffin, pride evident in its voice. ""The muffins, being a resilient bunch, quickly regained their footing and turned the tables on the gingerbread man. They outsmarted him and managed to sprinkle some powdered sugar on him.""

""The gingerbread man was covered from head to toe in white, looking like a mischievous snowman. And as he tried to shake it off, the muffins laughed so hard they started to crumble with joy!""

The first muffin couldn't stop laughing, ""That gingerbread man thought he was so clever, but the muffins had the last laugh!""

""And that, my friend,"" concluded the second muffin, ""is the tale of how two baking adventures intertwined, resulting in a hilarious oven encounter here and countless laughter in Muffinville!""

The first muffin was in tears of laughter. It realized that even in the heat of the oven, a good story could bring joy and make the sizzling situation a little brighter.

The third muffin sitting in the back of the oven said “holy shit, two talking muffins!”",1689424842.0

A Woman Brings Some Bread To Work... [OC] [long],3,14zjxd5,Jokes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/14zjxd5/a_woman_brings_some_bread_to_work_oc_long/,0,"A woman works in the Editorial Office of a newspaper and brings in a large, fresh loaf of bread. She puts it in the break room, where eight or so ""old boys"" are sitting around drinking coffee. She says, ""My husband is learning to bake and made this bread, but he made a mistake--""

But at that precise moment, her mobile rings and she steps out to take a call. One of the men suggests that they try the bread to determine the mistake, and the competition is on: Each grabs a slice and begins carefully eating a bite.

After a few moments, the art critic is sure that he's used the wrong grade of flour and begins explaining to everyone who will listen about how a 1050 grade will produce a darker white bread, obviously what has happened here.

The movie critic is absolutely certain that her husband added too much flour during kneading, which, as he slowly describes, stimulates gluten formation and results in a dense, stodgy bread that hasn't risen as much as desired.

The Chief chimes in, explaining how this kind of bread needed more steam during baking, wasn't sliced with a serrated bread knife, and points out that this bread could have done better in a seasoned aluminum tin.

The food critic, who has been silent this whole time, finally spells out his dismay, chiding the scoring shape and lack of originality in presenting such a plain loaf. Such a blunder is a clear sign of a novice and the critic is sure her boyfriend will not amount to much of a baker.

The woman, long since done with her call and standing in awe of how long this discussion has gone on, blurts out:

“Oh my, thank you young man, most people these days would just walk by and not say a thing. You are such a sweetie.”, she replies, drops the bags and starts collecting the money.

“How did an old lady like you get a full bag of money anyways?”

However my fence is old and full of holes, so the golfers tend to come next to the fence, stick it through the holes and pee all over my flowers. This really hurts my garden, so I have figured out a trick. When they put it in the hole, I am waiting there with gardening shears and I say: ‘Give me 100$ or off it goes.’”

*He soon found himself on an island with no flagstaff, no batmen, no ADC, no club, no canteen, no supplies, nothing, only bananas and coconuts.*

After about four months, he is lying on the beach one day... *when the most gorgeous woman he has ever seen rows up to the shore...*

In disbelief, he asks, 

""Where did you come from ? 
How did you get here ?"" 

She replies:
""I rowed over from the other side of the island_ where I landed when my cruise ship sank.""
 
""Amazing,"" he notes. ""You were really lucky to have a row boat wash up with you."" 

""Oh, this thing...?"" explains the woman : 

"" I made the boat out of some raw material I found on the island.

The oars were whittled from gum tree branches. 

I wove the bottom from palm tree branches, and the sides and stern came from an Eucalyptus tree.""

""But, where did you get the tools ?"" 

""Oh, that was no problem,"" replied the woman.

""On the south side of the island, a very unusual stratum of alluvial rock is exposed. 

I found that if I fired it to a certain temperature in my kiln, it melted into ductile iron and I used that to make tools and used the tools to make the hardware.""_

The General is stunned...!

""Let's row over to my place,"" she says ""and I'll give you a tour..."" 

So, after a short time of rowing, she soon docks the boat at a small wharf. 

As the old warhorse looks to shore, he nearly falls off the boat...!

Before him is a long stone walk leading to a cabin and tree house..

While the woman ties up the rowboat with an expertly woven hemp rope, the General can only stare ahead, dumb struck. 

As they walk into the house, she says casually :

*""It's not much, but I call it home. Please sit down.""*

*""Would you like a drink?""*

""No.. No.. thank you
..!"" the general blurts out, still dazed :

""I can't take another drop of coconut juice..."" 

""Oh, it's not coconut juice,"" winks the woman. ""I do have a 'still'...*

*Would you like a Whisky and Water ?""*

Trying to hide his continued amazement, he accepts, and they sit down on her couch to talk. 

After they exchange their individual survival stories, the woman announces :

*"" I'm going to slip into something more comfortable...*

*Would you like to take a shower and shave?*

*There's a razor in the bathroom cabinet upstairs in the VVIP room.""*

No longer questioning anything, the General goes upstairs into the 'bathroom'...

There... *in the cabinet is a razor made from a piece of tortoise bone.*

*Two shells honed to a hollow ground edge are fastened on to its end inside a swivel mechanism.*

******   *""This woman is amazing,"" he muses. ""What's next?""*

When he returns, she greets him wearing nothing but some small flowers on tiny vines, each strategically positioned, she smelled faintly of gardenias.

She then beckons for him to sit down next to her.

*""Tell me,"" she begins suggestively, slithering closer to him :*  

*""We've both been out here for many months.You must have been lonely....  When was the last time you played around ?*

**Guy from Yerevan**: ""Hey man, I've always wanted to go see Aparan, where you were born. How about we go there together one day?

He follows behind him for a bit, waiting for Da Vinci to head to the place he supposedly releases the Doves and other caged animals. On his way there, Da Vinci makes a quick stop to what Anthony assumes is his home. 

Da Vinci soon raemerges, carrying the same crate the Doves were in as before, but now with a tarp over top, still as Anthony follows. He makes his way down an alleyway and to a small desolate clearing in the city which was once a quiet market.

He then sets the crate down on a old rotting table, peeking under the tarp on an angle of the cage Anthony cannot view.

Anthony gets excited, crate in hand and ready to recover the Doves as Da Vinci throws the crates' door open, turning around and heading a different way he came.

Next, Mary said, “We are farmers too. We had twenty eggs waiting to hatch, but when they did we only got ten chicks.” The moral of this story is not to count your chickens before they’re hatched . “Very good,” said the teacher again, very pleased with the response so far.

Next it was Barney’s turn to tell his story: “My dad told me this story about my Aunt Karen. Aunt Karen was a flight engineer in the war and her plane got hit. She had to bail out over enemy territory and all she had was a bottle of whiskey, a machine gun and a machete.” “Go on,” said the teacher, intrigued.

“Aunt Karen drank the whiskey on the way down to prepare herself. Then she landed right in the middle of a hundred enemy soldiers. She killed seventy of them with the machine gun until she ran out of bullets. Then she killed twenty more with the machete till the blade broke.
