theory about Honor in stormlight 5 - MISTBORN ERA ONE SPOILERS INCLUDED,28,14yzk84,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14yzk84/theory_about_honor_in_stormlight_5_mistborn_era/,7,"I have a theory about what is going to happen in stormlight 5 (KOWT), SPOILERS  FOR MISTBORN ERA ONE, OATHBRINGER, AND RHYTHM OF WAR

I think that Dalinar or Navani or really just a bondsmith is going to use their powers to reforge Honor, and then Kaladin is going to pick up the shard.

We know about god metals that manifest as shards in the physical realm from Mistborn and scadrial, where the metal is the body of the god, and that shards can't be destroyed but they can be further split and combined with each other. At the end of oathbringer Jasnah mentions that Shallan's illusions almost seem to have weight which could be attributed to either soulcasting, *or the fact that stormlight has been observed to have a slight mass when concentrated.* When knights radiant use a lot of stormlight it is described as crystalizing in frost, Preservation manifests on scadrial as mist and mist crystalizes into frost, so I think that the stormlight is directly the power of Honor and can be concentrated back into the shard specifically with Dalinar's bondsmith abilities to create stormlight and perpendicularities that seem more directly tied to Honor's powers that even other surgebinding.

However, I don't think that Dalinar will be the one to pick up the shard. People ascending in stormlight got confirmed when Taravangian took over odium. Nale says the fifth ideal of the Skybreakers is to become the law, and the skybreakers are so close to the windrunners that it makes sense for the fifth ideal of the windrunners to be something similar and would be to become protection, and Kaladin is both the closest windrunner to the fifth ideal and the one who is closest to the ideals of the entire order. So it would make sense for once Honor is reforged, Kaladin's fifth ideal to be to take it up and protect everyone.",1689289831.0

In relistening to Words of Radiance, I heard something that made me think. In chapter 55, Kaladin, Shallan, and Adolin are riding in a carriage to the menagerie, driven by Wit >!(Hoid)!< and at some point in the trip, Wit trades places with another driver to finish the ride.

This other driver speaks ""with an unfamiliar accent"" and is wearing a *cap.* Kaladin is probably familiar with most accents on Roshar, having interacted with people from around the continent, but doesn't recognize this accent. 

I don't know the timeline between Roshar and Scadrial, but is it possible that this new driver is >!Wayne, after he is blown up?!< I know people from Scadrial have been >!brought back from the dead (Kelsier)!< and wonder if this could happen again.",1689295548.0
Usage of Aons on Roshar,44,14yj4xk,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14yj4xk/usage_of_aons_on_roshar/,11,"So as per my understanding, The Dor is what powers all Aons, regardless of location. But the Aon must include the location as a focus for the Dor. They're also variable. Elantris Aons only include their country, whereas Riina had an entire map of Lumar as a focus. 

So would they need to draw an entire map of roshar? Seems pretty intricate. Even just an outline would be rough. Plus, cities and regions that still inexplicably follow siematic patterns? These could easily throw off an Aon.

Alternatively, since we know one pattern matches Urithiru (presumably matching the tone of tower light), I wonder if these Aons would have any impact on the sibling. I imagine that drawing an Aon in the tower using the siblings pattern would have some sort of effect, if not on the Aon than on the sibling. The same could go for any siematic patterns and their related causes (unmade?)",1689250206.0

On Countering Soulcasting: Is Instantaneous Investiture of Metal Possible?,7,14yvzyr,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14yvzyr/on_countering_soulcasting_is_instantaneous/,10,"I was rereading RoW and once more came to the conclusion that it's only a matter of time before we have Surgebinders facing off against practitioners of the Metallic Arts.  Obviously, some match-ups favor one side more than the other, but a thought occurred to me. 

&#x200B;

If an Elsecaller or Lightweaver were practiced enough, they could soulcast a Metal user's weapon (and perhaps the bullets alone if they're particularly badass). The only things that would be immune to this would be the metalmind of a Feruchemist/ Twinborn, a hemalugic spike, or an aluminum weapon as they are invested/ investiture repellant respectively. Seeing as Aluminum isn't yet in easy supply on Scadrial, the only way to counter a soulcaster is to invest the weapons/ projectiles. Seeing as hemalurgy is both immoral and inefficient, is there anything to suggest that an entity could rapidly invest an object to resist soulcasting?",1689281195.0
Question on compounding,7,14yt3co,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14yt3co/question_on_compounding/,25,"Afraid to search through posts for fear of spoilers of The Last Metal which I just started listening to, so please no TLM spoilers. But I was reading about Feurochemy and speculating what compounding effects when I realize something.

I always assumed compounding was what Vinn was experimenting with when she tried to swallow Sazeds metal minds and burn it, she talked about being able to sense the power inside the metal mind but not being able to access it. I always assumed this was what compounding was, that this was what the Lord Ruler did as well as Miles Hundred Lives. Storing an attribute, then burning it to release that attribute with a net gain in increased potential. 

But we never hear about anyone grinding up their metal minds, Miles didn't need to chug down gold flakes in vials he invested with health to burn like Waxillium needs to do for his Iron, and he kept compounding as long as he had his metal mind at the end. 

So is this not compounding then?? And what the hell is compounding in that case? How does Miles, and the lord ruler, burn the metal if they didn't swallow it like Allomancers have to do? And what happens if you DO swallow and burn a metal you invested with an attribute??

So many questions...",1689274394.0

Part of a Space Travel Theory,6,14ys8ub,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14ys8ub/part_of_a_space_travel_theory/,0,"In Era 2 of Mistborn Khriss questions Wax about the conservation of momentum when he's flying. If you are in space and you throw an object away from you, then you move in the opposite direction. If you were an Iron ferring and stored all your weight(assuming your suit is weightless) then you would begin to move with infinite speed as speed must be infinite to balance the 0 weight.

There are of course a few problems with this.

1) Interstellar medium would slow you down. I don't have a concrete fix for this. Perhaps some sort of gravitational deflection with surges or Bands of Morning push to the side on the interstellar medium.
2) Your suit(and spaceship) have weight. However, from what we've seen of Ishar, it's possible to make investiture see outside materials as part of your body and therefore should be possible to alter the weight of those previously mentioned materials.
3) Infinite speed isn't possible in our dimension(don't know about the Cosmere). Due to the speed of light, I'd be interested to see what would happen in the proposed scenario.
Although, from what we see at the end of TLM, traveling faster than light may be possible(I haven't seen any consensus on whether Wayne traveled faster than light as Harmony was frozen and the light shifted(he started using Connection to see)).



Also(Not that connected to the theory), a ferring that can store heat could possibly convert a star into investiture. Pretty neat.",1689272379.0

First of all, dont get me wrong, I love Hoids character! He's funny and mysterious, and extremely involved in everything that happens in the cosmere.

But I feel that the last two books, Tress and Yumi, he is put in a role that I dont appreciate.

He becomes the all knowing storyteller, and I feel he gives to much information that I wish we could learn through things happening in the plot. It feels to easy just to have Hoid tell us a lot of information that is missing.

I feel that in stormlight, we had to scrape information from little tidbits and hints. And even though Hoid was an integral part of the plot, he wasn't only for information or resolution of the plot.

And thats another thing I feel happens in the last two books, Hoid (and Design in Yumi) act a bit like ""deus ex machina"". In Tress, if not for Hoid, tress wouldn't be able to beat Riina. and in Yumi, Design is able to change the situation for Yumi and Painter, and gives crucial information with a fabrial. (Thats the part I am at. So please no spoilers after this point!)

Still I very much enjoy the books! But it feels a bit like an easy way for Brandon to tie the plot together.

RoW: Wit,64,14y55xi,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14y55xi/row_wit/,29,"Okay so last night I got thinking about Wit and Jasnah again, and felt the urge to reread the scene where they take down Ruthar. I carefully checked the copper mind to find out which chapter it was in, and as I was scrolling I saw mention of Wit using Soothing in a Shallan flashback in one of the previous books, which together with having started listening to The Sanderlanche podcast, put emotional Allomancy back into my working memory.

With that context, do you think Wit Rioted Ruthar during that exchange?

The specific lines that made me think of it was when it was pointed out about the loss of Title etc. for killing a Wit and it's mentioned as starting to sink in for Ruthar, but then he just leans into it and goes off again. This is of course entirely possible without emotional Allomancy, but I feel like some would be involved or at least planned as insurance to make sure the plan works out if he didn't take the bait on his own. It could have been Rioted/Soothed from the start, or only a little bit here or there, just overall feels like a situation that lines up well to have involved some.

I just love those pair of schemers and imagine they would have had plenty of backup plans to make sure it goes off without a hitch.

[Mistborn Secret History] Scadrial Santa Claus,14,14ydtcb,Cosmere,https://i.redd.it/72rqzqocoobb1.jpg,1,"Someone posted about this recently and my brain dove in full force.

Okay so if we think of Kelsier’s story as an allegory for Jesus (sacrificial death, resurrection, ascension, continuance) then we can consider Survivorism to be a Scadrian juxtaposition of Christianity on Earth (complete with silver spear necklaces to match our cross necklaces).  

If Scadrial has “Christianity” then Christmas should exist at some point (considering the number of “pagan” religions Sazed new about I’m sure we can find a tree decorating holiday to “colonize”).  

If Christmas exists we need a Santa.  But how would he work?  

My first thoughts are 

1: a full Feruchemist able to store his sense of self, his speed, and health, along with things like weight, etc to facilitate the 1 night present giving rampage. 
2: he would need to have something keeping him from turning evil AND make him immortal, so I’m thinking he has the same “Curse” that Hoid has. Whatever it is that keeps him from dying/ harming other people, Scadrian Santa needs that too. 

What else everyone? How would Santa exist in Scadrial?

The Book of Genesis and the origins of the Cosmere,24,14yaxzo,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14yaxzo/the_book_of_genesis_and_the_origins_of_the_cosmere/,10,"***I feel compelled before I even begin this post to say that like Jasnah I am an atheist. I'm not looking to tie the Cosmere to Christian scripture for any personal gain and if along the way I accidentally say something that offends someone of any religious stripe, you have my sincerest apologies. I also freely acknowledge that I am far from an Abrahamic scholar and may have misinterpreted some things. Final note, I use the pronoun ""he"" when referring to the Abrahamic God, because that is generally the pronoun used in the Old Testament. Nothing is meant to be endorsed or implied.***

I've been thinking a lot about Commands and Intent. How and why the Dawnshards ever ended up in the hands of man in the first place and why they were used to shatter Adonalsium. As I dug in, I've begun to think the origins of the Cosmere may be an allegory for the book of Genesis.

The speaking of Commands with Intent behind them bear a strong resemblance to what happens in Genesis 1, which starts with God issuing the Command ""Let there be light"" with a far more complex intent behind it; Brandon has stated in an interview :

>""It's a similar thing that the Intent of a Command is often vaster than the actual words spoken. And the magic can grasp the Intent, not just the Command, depending on the magic system and how good you are at it, and things like that. The words are there to focus Intent.""

The words that God speaks in Genesis are obviously far simpler than the creation of the universe; in the same vein the Dawnshards are Commands so profound they created the Cosmere.

We all know that one of the Dawnshards, held by Rysn, is ""Change."" In Genesis 1:3 - 1:19, God repeatedly issues a Command that changes the shape and nature of the Universe - he calls forth light from the void, separates the waters from the waters (makes the sky), another change to create dry land from the sea, etc. etc.. That gets us through the first four days of the Abrahamic creation story with just one Command, with varied Intent.

On the fifth day and sixth day, God created animals, fish, and birds, but to them he issued an additional Command in Genesis 1:23: "" Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters of the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” "" In Genesis 1:24 he issues a similar Command to the animals.

This would seem to be a second Command, which for the sake of convenience I will call ""Expand."" It orders living creatures to fill out every corner of the Earth.

Things get interesting in Genesis 1:26, when God creates man in his image and after his likeness. I think there's a third Command implied there. I don't have a great word for it. Right now I'm settling for ""Experience,"" in the sense of ""Experiencing an event."" It means that Man has been commanded to be aware of the universe.

God immediately speaks to Man after creating him and issues a fourth Command. Similar to Expand, but with an additional instruction in Genesis 1:28:  “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and every creature that crawls upon the earth.” 

This would be a Command of ""Control.""

From there Man settles into the Garden of Eden (Yolen), in the middle of which was the Tree of Life (Adonalsium?) and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil (The Dawnshards?). This sort of ""wellspring of life"" seems to me to fit in more closely with what we have seen and heard of Adonalsium than God. Adonalsium is the source of Investiture and there is non-Investiture magic (Aether) in the Cosmere. 

Mankind promptly meets up with Serpents/Dragons/Sho-Del and screws up Paradise by claiming knowledge and power for himself, and everything promptly goes to crap.

It's definitely not a perfect analogy, but it doesn't have to be. Allegories are by their nature somewhat obfuscated from the source material they reference. 

As a bonus, if I've got the four commands right, here's my thoughts about which Shards are related to which Dawnshards:

Change: Ruin, Invention, Endowment, Whimsy (the ""whim"" definition, not the lightheartedness).

Expand: Cultivation, Autonomy, Ambition, Unknown Shard who wants to survive.

Control: Dominion, Preservation, Honor, Wisdom.

Experience: Odium, Virtuosity, Mercy, Devotion.

As a bonus to the bonus, I suspect Hoid held the ""Experience"" Dawnshard.",1689223514.0
Different takes on shards?,5,14ykly0,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14ykly0/different_takes_on_shards/,0,"One of the running themes in the Cosmere has been that while the shard itself has strict boundaries on the vessel, the vessel has some say in shaping the nature of their shard. Therefore, can you think of different ways in which different vessels could greatly change the way in which some of the shards have been seen in the Cosmere? 

&#x200B;

For me, I am most interested in Autonomy/Bavadin: she is definitely more the libertarian/colonialist type, almost egoistic in her morality. However, I'd like to see an autonomy who is just an academic in charge of their Institutional Review Board (IRB). Rather than taking over planets, she would see all interactions with humans by other shards as necessitating varying degrees of review in order to adhere with the first principle of the IRB regarding respect for persons:

&#x200B;

*""Respect for Persons:  Human subjects must be treated as autonomous and able to make responsible choices. Respect for persons incorporates at least two ethical convictions: (1) that individuals should be treated as autonomous agents, and (2) that persons with diminished autonomy are entitled to protection. The principle of respect for persons thus divides into two separate moral requirements: (1) the requirement to acknowledge autonomy and (2) the requirement to protect those with diminished autonomy. This principle leads to the requirement of informed voluntary consent.""*

&#x200B;

In such a case, she would immediately crash The Lord Ruler's attempt to create two different subspecies of humans, the Kandra, Koloss, etc. as all in clear violation of respect for persons. TLR would therefore begrudgingly be forced to not go full on N\*\*i scientist. 

&#x200B;

In Warbreaker, I imagine that she'd go the comparativist political scientist route of insisting that any attempt to secure breaths would first require the establishment of a base level of wealth in order to meet basic needs a la a universal basic income. From there, people would not be in a life or death position where if they refuse to sell their breaths, they starve to death.

&#x200B;

In any case, this seems like an area that could be fun to explore, and I'd be interested in hearing everyone else's ideas.

"Yumi was amazing, but I need to (lowly) rant.",14,14y8x2l,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14y8x2l/yumi_was_amazing_but_i_need_to_lowly_rant/,0,"So Yumi might just be the (highly) *best* book I've ever read, but despite this there were a few things that bothered me, especially towards the ending. I'm curious if anyone else had the same thoughts, or if it was just me. Also sorry this might be pretty long, this rant has been boiling in me since I finished it. 

\#1: Nikaro vs. Painter

So the carnival chapter was one of my favorites, but also marked my first disappointment with the book. Throughout the book Nikaro thinks of himself as ""Painter"", and the book does as well. It's a cool character detail, but the further I got into the book, the more it started to feel like the name was an aspect of his toxic perception of himself. Then the carnival chapter hit, and Yumi starts calling him by his real name: Nikaro. At that moment it clicked. Nikaro would say something along the lines of ""but I'm useless, I failed them"", and then Yumi would say something like ""Your value as a person isn't about your painting skills, it's about you"", and then it would all change. Nikaro would start to see himself as himself, not his ability to paint, and the book would follow suit. I read with baited breath, waiting for the moment... 

Oh well. Not gonna stop *me* from calling him Nikaro. 

\#2: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_'s way!

So that pair of moments when they each take inspiration from each other to overcome something was really cool, I must've had the silliest grin on my face. But then I thought about it, and it doesn't *really* make sense. Nikaro looking to his friends doesn't really seem like Yumi's influence, as opening up to others is something they *both* have to overcome, and Yumi escaping on the tree was originally Nikaro's idea, but didn't really feel like a significant enough part of the plot to be worth the way that moment was written. Now don't get me wrong, it's a really cool moment and I don't care at all, but I couldn't stop thinking about it, and I (frustratingly) came up with something that (to me) is just way better. 

The first half of the book, to me, felt like it was setting up a theme that felt like it just faded away in the later parts. This being Nikaro and Yumi's disagreement on the nature of art. So I was thinking, how could this have been integrated into the ending? Ok so hear me out. Let's say the plot happens as normal, except without that moment, until:

Nikaro is fighting the Nightmares with the group, but it's not going well, they're starting to break through. But he thinks of a better way: Yumi's way. He calls back to Yumi talking about how order is important in art, her saying he needs to focus on stacking rocks with the whole tower in mind, one of his old drawings of a crowd where each person had a personality, and his knowledge of the origin of the Nightmares and the Torish festival (which you'd have to add in Yumi telling him about), he makes one painting of the festival as he imagines it, and the Nightmares all find their place in it and are transformed. 

Then we cut to Yumi, who's trying to overcome the machine with stacking. But it's simply capable of stacking so fast, and it's towers aren't *significantly* worse. She doesn't manage to steal that many, despite doing better than ever before. But then she thinks of a better way, Nikaro's way. She remembers what he said about the grain and shadows on that one rock that one time, and realizes that what she overlooked before is the key. She knocks down her masterpiece and starts anew, this time incorporating the colors and grain of the rocks into a cohesive picture. This is finally enough, and the spirits flood to her. 

\#3: Well I know this one isn't unique to me

So yeah. The end. I liked it better than many, but I still have to acknowledge that it felt cheap. At least I do now, at the time I was too busy crying with joy. For narrative reasons, I do believe that Yumi coming back is the right ending, but I think it could've been done better. 

So after the battle is won, and Yumi evaporates, we go straight into the second (but now first) epilogue with a bittersweet taste in our mouths, and Hoid wakes up. (Quick bonus #4, I can't *believe* Sanderson ignored the comedic potential of ""THIS COATRACK IS (LOWLY) ALIVE?!?!?!?!""). He explains everything just like he does in the current ending, and it seems like the book is about to end. But then: ""And as for Nikaro, well... **Second Epilogue**"". We cut to Nikaro, and he's alone in his apartment thinking about Yumi. He notices the connection that they still share (because heavily invested entities linger after death), and wanders out to his spot on the building. He begins to paint her, and the Shroud (which is still slowly evaporating), begins to respond. A painting could never perfectly capture a person, but art is about more than a picture. Nikaro has spent every moment of the last several weeks with her, spent countless days in her body. He *knows* her, like no one else could. The connection between them is the last ingredient, and from there we cue the original ending, and Yumi returns. 

Well if you made it through all that, thanks for listening to me I guess. Let me know if you like my version better, or if I'm just going crazy. Scratch that, I definitely am going crazy. ",1689217447.0

What could he possibly mean by this is something that the fantasy market in general is lacking / needs a series? 

Funny enough, my mind went to some random slice of life story about a traveling carnival where the performers use certain powers from across the world in new, fun and interesting ways. Then the main conflict could potentially be them losing their jobs or something because the carnival isn't making enough money. 

This also sounds like something weird and random that Brandon and Dan would just come up with and want to write. At the same time I'm not sure if that's really something the markets wants and is begging to have.

Yumi and Tress as first Cosmere book recommendations,21,14xwoli,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14xwoli/yumi_and_tress_as_first_cosmere_book/,32,"Hi so I'm a big fantasy and sci fan, I've read all of the Cosmere, but I'm also into romance and fantasy romance (from like Acotar and Zodiac Academy to Six of Crows and Twilight) . I've always tried to get fellow romance readers into the Cosmere, and my go to recommendation was always Mistborn. It often went over well but was hit or miss for some. Then the fantastic Mrs. Sanderson got Brandon to try his hand at romance more and we were given ***the gifts*** that are Tress and Yumi, and this has changed everything!

I guess the point of this post is sort of a PSA that if you have romance book wives or girlies in your life, recommend these books to them. Tress has been picking up steam on BookTok, and I think Yumi will do the same, especially being enemies to lovers and forced proximity (so freaking good). After falling in love with Sanderson via these two books, I definitely see a lot of them continuing into Mistborn; Vin is a very relatable FMC and the plot with Elend is just sooo good (plus all the saving the world stuff). Yumi and Tress are both stand alone novels that (despite the very important Cosmere and Realmatic reveals in them) don't need any other Cosmere prerequisites to understand and love.

What are your thoughts on this? I just think this is a great opportunity to bring in many new fans to the Cosmere, outside of the OG regular (but obvi amazing) epic fantasy fans. ",1689186791.0

My scattered thoughts on Secret Project 3 (Finished yesterday),3,14xy7b2,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14xy7b2/my_scattered_thoughts_on_secret_project_3/,5,"Wow! How can one love and hate an author at the same time? The very literal emotional roller coaster he sent me on with this book. This guy!

So many thoughts, I’ll try to go chronologically. So let’s start off with the narrator: So my very first thought was that it felt silly that the voice sounded as goofy as the last book I read, since the last book was by Hoid, it just felt odd that this book would have a similar tone. Some time later on, specifically the second time the narrator mentioned the reader as a Rosharan I realised this had to be a worldhopper in Roshar. With a similar voice as Hoid? Who was Hoid’s apprentice in the SA? Sigzil. This must be in the future when Sigzil has been trained to be a worldhopping storyteller like Hoid. I missed the first mention of Design. Mainly because it actually sounds like a real name, like Hope. Then the narrator mentioned how proud he was of Design’s… well design, and now, very incorrectly, I thought that Hoid had loaned Design to Sigzil, which simply doesn’t makes sense, Sigzil is a Windrunner, not a Lightweaver, so how did he make her body? Painter passed the hawkish statue and I realised what was going on. 

In my defence, I was under the impression that only 1 Cosmere book was gonna be from Hoid’s perspective. We already had Tress with Hoid being the storyteller, so I didn’t think this book was Hoid’s as well.

Now let’s go to the actual story. I absolutely loved the setting, a dayless world with living nightmares, while the city looks like (in my mind) those small alleyways in Japan and China with neon lights. I just realised that Hion lights sounds like Neon lights, so I guess that’s how the name came about. I instantly connected with Painter. I had no idea Brandon decided to add me into the story. But man, I love darkish settings, worlds where there’s clearly something wrong about it, but people are used to it and live their lives, like Mistborn Era 1, which is still my favourite setting, now SP3 is my second favourite.

Yumi on the other hand, first chapter went well, the second and third (if I remember them correctly) made me get worried. *Is this gonna be another Serene from Elantris situation?* I found Serene’s chapters a bore. I mean, they were mildly interesting, but I hated every time we had to move away from Raoden. I even took a month long break just because I didn’t feel like reading Serene’s chapter and thanks to the triad format I knew the next chapter was hers. And I found Yumi’s chapters only mildly interesting while Painter’s world was much more interesting. Actually now that I think about it, that was also the reason I liked Raoden’s chapters, because we got to see the City in his chapters. Luckily the Swap happened and Yumi became interesting. Actually in retrospect I realise it wasn’t Yumi, but her world that I found only mildly interesting, because I always longed the Painter’s world chapters.

But man did this book hook me. Like… when I start a new book series, I often read like 3 chapters before I feel a need to take a break because getting into a new world is always daunting to me. I had trouble getting into Mistborn Era 1, Era 2, Stormlight, Tress, Elantris, Warbreaker. I still am only at 7% of SP2 (And I honestly don’t think I will finish it, because unlike Tress, it’s not Cosmere, so I have no incentive to quickly finish it so I can safely browse r/cosmere). No matter the series I always felt… unsatisfied at the start of my reading journey. The first book is always difficult for me. So when I say that this book got me hooked, I mean it got me HOOKED. I thought I’d just try out a few chapters early in the day. I didn’t leave my computer (where I was reading) for 8 hours straight. I “tried” to take a break. Because my experience tells me I need to take a break so I don’t lose focus. I started up youtube, first video only like half a minute passes and I’m already getting tired of my “break” so I close it down and get back to SP3. I got half way through the book. The next two days were work days, so I couldn’t just binge read it again, instead I sacrificed a few hours of sleep to be able to burn through this book as quickly as possible. So 3 days it took me. 3 (lowly) days! It took me a MONTH to get through Tress.

Anyway, once I had finished my first day of reading I was excited about it and wanted to talk to my friend about it. When I started describing it, I realised something… There is no plot. Sure MAAAYBE that Stable Nightmare will be the big bad of the story, but like… it felt more like a subplot. Just a little background thing to keep the characters motivated a bit. There was this whole spirits’ freedom thing, but we still didn’t know anything about it at this point. Really this book had just been these 2 hanging out… that’s when it dawned on me… Has Brandon tricked me into reading a romance novel? AND I love it? Sure Warbreaker is kind of a romance novel, but I really didn’t care much for Siri and Susebron. I was interested in Vivenna and Vasher (wait why do both of them share their first letter with their chapter partners?). But here I was; spent 8 hours straight with no breaks, and I absolutely cannot stop reading. Since we’re on the topic of Yumi, can i just say the art of her was gorgeous. I had to take a break each time an illustration of her came up just to bask in the beauty. Sorry, I said I would try to keep this in chronological order, too hard.

The next day I realised something. Did Brandon foreshadow the ending would be a sad one with that talk about the Drama Yumi and Painter had? It better not be sad! Oh god, it’s actually so difficult to keep this chronological. I honestly thought Yumi and Painter would reveal their secret to Akane’s group, unlike Yumi’s world, Painter’s world would be much easier to prove it since Painter can manipulate their technology in his Ghost form. I’m surprised that they didn’t reveal the truth to Masaka either, after her true nature was revealed. Eh, screw the chronology. What IS Yumi? Is she a splinter of Virtuosity? I mean in the sense that Returned are splinters of Endowment. Not that she’s a Spren, but someone who was granted a piece of god. Or did the machine kill Virtuosity which in turn scattered her power (I think the shard was referred to as her) and a few people were granted it, like Yumi.   
Anyway now jumping to Painter and Nightmare Liyun. I’m a bit confused about the motivations of Liyun, as Hoid explained, Liyun went into the city when the Spirits contacted Yumi, searching for… what? And what happened to that other town destroyed by the Nightmares? It sounded like that was a deliberate attack, just as the attack on Painter’s city was gonna be deliberate, but why was that first town sacked? I thought perhaps Yumi or another Yoki-Hijo had already done this soul swap before, Painter wasn’t the first. But then in Hoid’s explanation, it seemed that Yumi really was the first. Also the Nightmares’ fear of ink was never explained, or… what was it that Nightmare Liyum was afraid of from Painter’s back that it had to take a wide berth?

Aw man, let’s talk about the ending. I’ve heard people say that a story was a emotional roller coaster, but usually they just mean that there was a false sad part, then a good ending. But THIS story, holy me, the fate of the characters seemed to keep jumping up and down, up and down. Oh no, Yumi is not real, she will have to die at the end, no wait, she’s different, she escaped the control of the machine, she’ll live, oh no, she’s still part of the machine, she will die when she destroys it, but no she’s so invested maybe she’s already a cognitive shadow and won’t fade, nooo she’s leaving after having destroyed the machine, it’s over for her. W-what’s going on Painter, what are you doi- Yumi is actually back?!

Man, I really felt it. I thought this really was going to be a bittersweet ending. Yumi and Painter saved the world, but they’ll never be together. Painter would have to move on with his life. I had no tears left in me when Painter started painting his masterpiece. THANK god Brandon can’t resist writing happy endings.

What’s the definition of Awakened objects? Do they HAVE to be Awakened with Breaths, or does any raw investiture allow Awakening, like an Elantrian? Also, would Hoid have really just stayed there for all eternity until the machine was destroyed? He’s lucky the story started only 3 years into his prison. Also also, at first I thought Hoid’s memory loss was what happened at the end of SA 4, but Design made it feel like it was REALLY humiliating to Hoid, which couldn’t have been something as simple as just Hoid forgetting 1 conversation, so either something much bigger happens in the future, or Hoid didn’t JUST forget his conversation with Todium.

My thoughts on SP3 would have been more coherent if I had written this right after finishing, unfortunately, I had work the next day, so now I’ve had a whole day of getting my mind jumbled with everything I learned and now I can’t really put my thoughts into words. I definitely had A LOT more opinions on Painter and Yumi, but now I just feel... blank, my mind is resting from the excitement from yesterday. One of the possibilities I thought of was that Yumi and Painter would share his body, swapping between each other once the ghost version fully embraced the body version. Also I was thinking was the warm feeling they felt when touching each other the same feeling the people in Warbreaker feel when they get a massive boost of investiture?",1689190252.0

Thankfully, and at great cost, of course, our protagonists are able to prevent either one from occurring, so we never get a POV look at what exactly the army of Red and Gold even is. I believe we do get a bit more information in project #1 that seems to imply they could be awakened metal statues or something of the like which would be cool and make perfectly good sense. But I dunno, man. I feel like Brandon is a pretty darn purposeful author and for him to explicitly ascribe colors to this invading force, colors that match the colors that he has confirmed to be associated with Odium, inclines me to believe that Odium is somehow involved here. The timelines also match up reasonably well as era 2 is after ""era 1"" of SA, which would free Odium up to be invading other planets, likely even regardless of the outcome of the duel against the Knights Radiant on Roshar.

**Elantris**

* Design says that Yumi is Invested to the same level as an Elantrian.
* Hoid compares the hijo to seons.

**Mistborn: The Final Empire**

* Hoid suggests that tin Allomancy would allow someone to see through the shroud.
* Hoid and Design steal a spaceship to reach the Iron Seven Waystation, presumably a Scadrian space station based on the name.

**The Lost Metal**

* The aliens living on UTol are Sho Del--beings which made their first canonical appearance in MeLaan's epilogue in the Lost Metal.

**Warbreaker**

* Design compares Yumi's level of Investiture to that of a Returned.
* Hoid says the machine was Awakened. (though it's unclear if Breath was involved)
* The black smoke from the shroud is reminiscent of the black smoke that bleeds from Nightblood.

**The Way of Kings**

* Hoid narrates the story to Rosharans:
   * Painter is described as looking Veden but with paler skin than you would find on Roshar
   * rice grains are compared to those on Roshar
   * he mentions being on Komashi for three Rosharan years
   * he mentions chulls and chasmfiends
   * he compares the heat of the ground to the beaches of the Reshi Isles
   * compares the spirit lights to using spheres for light
   * mentions Cultivation
   * mentions a plant native to Roshar called a duluko
   * and uses the Shin honorific suffix '-nimi'.
* A fabrial is used to measure Nikaro's levels of Investiture, with results that seem to display in women's script.
* The spirits and nightmares are similar to spren in the way they respond to humans.

**Edgedancer**

* Masaka is a Sleepless.

**Oathbringer**

* The nightmares, and to some degree the shroud, appear similar to Midnight Essence.

**Rhythm of War**

* Design plays a significant role in the story, having been given the appearance and semblance of a body with a complex Lightweaving.
* Hoid says 'we all kind of learned our lesson' on giving actual bodies to spren, which likely refers to Ishar's experiments on spren.
* Hoid's 'protections' that turned him into a statue seem to have been created in response to what happened when Odium tampered with his memories in the Rhythm of War epilogue.
* The spirits can be bound into devices like spren into fabrials

**Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell**

* Design says Komashi is stranger than any planet she's ever been to, including Threnody

Note that this doesn't include more general cosmere references that can't really be pointed at a particular book, including:

Adonalsiums plan,8,14xc417,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14xc417/adonalsiums_plan/,13,"Hello fellow cosmernaughts. I wanted to have a discussion on the big A i've been pondering the reality behind the shattering and where the end point for the cosmere will be. 

I wouldn't be surprised to find this theory has been floating around for a while.

So first i will present an idea to you all.

How does an omniscient, immortal being understand the plight of its creations?

I think Adonalsium was aware of its eventual shattering. I think it knew it had grown out of touch with humanity, a creation representing every aspect of its own character. In a sense humans represent an entropic force in the worlds they inhabit. This comes up most notably through the SA.
Now what if Adonalsium was accutely aware it needed a better perspective and also lacked the ability to spread itself across the cosmere to gain new experiences from all forms of perspectives.

Along comes a group, fed up with its design and Adonalsium allows their plan to succeed shattering it into 16 distinct personalities. Which in turn leave the system to create their own worlds and live their own existences. Gaining experience from their unique excursions.

Roshar the system was made before the shattering and seems to have a specific design. A design to what? Well what are the surges we see Honors bondsmith wielding? Its in the name. he bonds things! sticks them back together on a fundamental level. And i think the whole system shares this purpose. To reunite the shards after their scattering across the cosmere.

Further to this i think Odiums goal to shatter the remnants is ultimetly a life preserving measure. It knew there was an eventual end by which they will all rejoin and thus works to shatter shards and continue existence in its current form.

This post is for myself as a time capsule, it will be fun in 10 years to see if i was on the right track or totally off. So i encourage anyone to comment with for and against arguments lets have a brainstorm on the subject and share theories on what we think will be the eventual outcome!

Other interesting questions to answer

Whats Thaidakars ultimate goal?

Whats Hoids goal?

Will Dalinar merge 3 shards, honor, odium &  cultivation to make unity?

Will we see a penultimate battle royal between shards?

Does locking a shards power in one domain prevent this goal of connecting them together again?

Part of what I love about reading fantasy novels and Branderson specifically is feeling immersed in a whole new world. I find the exposition* - constant analogies to another cosmere world to explain things like the quality of sand (lol)- completely unnecessary. It feels jarring and cheesy. Brandon is a strong enough writer, and we’re all imaginative enough readers, to not need interjections that compare the fantasy world to one more similar to our own. Let me not understand things!

Those who held the power of ascension,7,14wy352,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14wy352/those_who_held_the_power_of_ascension/,8,"EDIT- okay, I just finished. Secret History. I get it now. 

Mistborn spoilers through halfway into bands of mourning, but it might just be shadows of self because I don’t remember when this came up. 

At one point, someone was recalling those who held the power of ascension (or maybe power of preservation?) and they listed out certain characters from era 1 - vin, kelsier, ~~Elend~~Rashek, and Sazed. Now, three of those make sense but I don’t recall kelsier coming anywhere near the well. I thought maybe this is a result of people thinking he came back to life when the Kandra was going around pretending to be him, so they assume he held the power which is what brought him back to life. But considering how thoroughly Sazed seems to have covered those events in his book, I feel like that part was probably clarified/debunked for the general public as well. 

If this is just a RAFO moment, then so be it. Maybe it happened more recently than I remember, but I thought that was mentioned in Shadows of Self, so if it’s part of another secret, then I’m kind of surprised it hasn’t been addressed by now. Or is it just Sanderson showing how people misunderstand the details of events that took place several hundred years ago?

The power of perception,7,14wt1lf,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14wt1lf/the_power_of_perception/,10,"Yumi and the Nightmare Painter focuses on art, but not just differences in perspective but also perception.

Perception is very important in the cosmere as it generally coincides with Intent, though mostly focused on the cognitive and spiritual aspects of a person, bleeding into the physical. A prime example is how Invested healing works.

We see that Identity-less (or Identity-injured) spiritwebs are extremely vulnerable to perception. Even highly Invested beings are not free of this. (See: The Heralds or The Returned.)

Yumi and Nikaro do this throughout the book (although most of Yumi’s are via memory illusion). I believe that Yumi self-actualized using her Connection to Nikaro. (Kind of like the Heralds.)

The primary question I’ll ask here is: How powerful is Yumi, the yoki-hijo?

I believe a yoki-hijo is a range that largely surrounds the Investiture level of a Returned.

Working on a investiture table, I’d list Yumi as:

Range: (DB - Ya) to (DB + Yb)

DB = 2000B or a divine breath

Ya = the difference that prevents Yoki-Hojo from being ageless as there’s no indication that they are

Yb = the difference that accounts for what Design sees in Yumi. It’s static investiture as we don’t see the anything to imply it’s a rate akin to an Elantrian. Yumi may also be a Savant—but how does that translate to how Invested one is?

This is faulty because I’m assuming with no evidence that the Yoki-Hojo aren’t born as highly Invested—because they could very well simply deplete their investiture resources via summoning and controlling spirits. (Thoughts?) Yumi also seems to be more powerful than average. (My crackpot theory is that she is the 13th of 14 Yoko-hijo.)

If you would like: I have Returned at DB (plus maintenance in breath as a unit) and Elantrian at DB + X breath per unit time. I don’t know about Heralds either. Don’t get me started on the Fused (who can reshape their bodies , but not self-actualize) or Vivenna/Siri (who can, but aren’t close to being that Invested).

Heralds and Yumi seem to be around similar levels and have similarities but Yumi lacks the common superhuman physical traits that Returned, Elantrian, and Heralds have.

A second question arises: Do you think we will see more of this Splinter control and actualization from highly Invested beings for Shards without Vessels and themselves?",1689085942.0
New Shards,2,14x6u7f,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14x6u7f/new_shards/,3,"With shaky timelines and a low likelyhood of books/series set with all the other shards we haven't directly seen yet, I think we could still see multiple new shards in future eras.

As in, shards shattered/splintered by other shards throughout the cosmere, and the shard which hasn't been directly referenced by name yet if I'm still correct, could be merged like Harmony or theoretically split into two. 

Harmony is no stronger than Ruin and/or Preservation, if anything he's weaker for being bound by opposite (mostly) intents.

This leads me to assume that (because infinity/2 is still infinity), if invention were split into something like creation and innovation, they'd both still be equally as powerful as the other shards, potentially stronger for not having been bound by the intent of their opposite within the original shard. 

I could be completely wrong though, just tossing out theories.",1689117246.0

He takes a few over the books, he likes the name Wit in Stormlight, which was more like a title. The most common Name he is called by is Hoid, which is a way to spot him in a lot of different books. In Rhythm of War we learn that he has another name, Cephandrius. That is probably one of his oldest names, since Rayse (Odium) knows him but that name and calls him that.

It makes a lot of sense thinking about it.

Why do people say Kelsier is bad?,145,14uoiol,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14uoiol/why_do_people_say_kelsier_is_bad/,274,"Spoilers for all cosmere up to The Lost Metal.

EDIT: 

After reading comments I understand how Kesier is driven by questionable morals in TFE. I still don’t see his actions as very different than those that we see from other characters in the cosmere, but his intent is more evil. He wants to kill and he likes it. He just channels his murderous intent into a just cause. 

I also would not classify his actions as genocide, as some comments suggest. He murders along class lines, and mostly toward his ultimate goal of toppling the final empire. We even see him spare nobles that he sees as innocent. A genocide is murdering a “national, ethnical, racial or religious group” according to the UN. We know Nobles are ethnically different, but Kelsier doesnt, and he is not motivated by a hatred for the race, only hatred for those that abuse their power. This includes Elend (even though I think Elend is a swell guy) for living in luxury off the backs of slaves in the pits.

Also, he seems to grow out of it by the end of the book, even saving Elend’s life. After his death and in all other appearances beyond TFE, he simply doesn’t seem like the same psychopath as he was when he was alive.

Many have also pointed out the WoB about Kelsier, which is useful, but not cannon. Contrary to popular belief around here WoB are not gospel and Brandon has said he can change his mind. Many of the WoB people link are from before we had any other characterization beyond TFE.

ORIGINAL:

I often see people saying that Kelsier would be a villain in any other story except Mistborn, or that Kelsier is morally grey, or even speculating that he will become the endgame villain of the cosmere. I just don’t buy it. 

In TFE, yes he murders quite a bit, but really only the people who perpetuate the horrific slave system under the lord ruler. I would say that Vin does far more heinous acts in tWoA. The death of the lord ruler led to Ruin returning and destroying the planet, but Kelsier didn’t know any of that would happen. 

As Thaidakar, you can say that he does some bad stuff on Roshar, but frankly it’s a bit tame compared to everything else going on on the planet. The ghostbloods kill a princess (unsuccessfully) and her boat’s crew. Well actually Shallan did some of that. And I’m still not really sure why they did that. Jasnah knew too much? idk. Jasnah herself does more murder herself than any single person we have even seen in just one chapter of RoW. 

After Veil joins the Ghostbloods, they don’t even do much but spy on and attack the Sons of Honor, who, by the way, helped cause the apocalypse. Mraize acts pretty evil, but he just kinda hangs around Urithiru, kidnaps Lift, who then escapes with Venli. He’s sort of a butt monkey frankly. His pet chicken does more evil acts than he does. 

Once we finally meet Kelsier again in TLM, he still seems morally good. The gang joins Marasi and they help save the day. They also imply that the Ghostbloods on Roshar sorta do their own thing, so all those acts aren’t even 100% Kelsier’s call. 

In conclusion, if killing nobles and stealing power makes him “morally grey”, I don’t see why that makes him different than any other protagonist in the cosmere. I know Moash is also all about the noble murder life, but frankly I didn’t see him as fully irrideemable until RoW. After that Fuck Moash.

If I got anything wrong or you disagree, please let me know. For now, I am confused as to why anyone says Kelsier anything but a cool guy.",1688875667.0

My marathon started in January of 2021 with Mistborn, which led to the rest of Era 1 and Era 2. After that, I knew I wanted to go into the Stormlight Archive and went through all four books with only a brief pause for a palate cleanser when I was waiting for Warbreaker and Edgedancer between Words of Radiance and Oathbringer.

Holy heck, can this man write!! I can’t believe he’s so prolific and so consistent. I know I had some rough patches with Era 2 and Rhythm of War (until Part 4), but I find it so hard to believe he puts out so much great content so quickly. And each Sanderlanche still catches me off guard! I know they’re coming, but I still find myself realizing I’m in the middle of it bout 50 pages in.

My favorites have to be the Stormlight Archive. There’s so much to them, and it all builds so well. I admittedly had a hard time with Words of Radiance, but there was some great redemption at the end.

Least favorite? Era 2, hands down. Granted, I haven’t read the Lost Metal, but I feel like they didn’t have that same inspiration as Era 1.

Sadly, I’m a little burned out, but who wouldn’t be after nearly 2.5 years of reading the same author? I know when I’m ready to revisit his works that I’ll have a lot more to read (Lost Metal, the Secret Projects, and whatever else he releases), and I’m really excited to visit those when the time comes.

The funniest one for me in retrospect is that I thought the Thrill was of Whimsy. **I can explain myself though**

I read the Stormlight Archive after finishing almost everything else, including The Lost Metal (which mentions Whimsy). The spren in general seem *incredibly* whimsical, especially near the beginning of TWOK with Syl still figuring out who she is and windspren being known to pull pranks on people. It seemed like Whimsy was a clear choice for this planet.

And that lead to thinking about what other manifestations of Investiture could be ascribed to Whimsy: Investiture associated with activities people do for fun or that bring them happiness. Shallan's Memory was capitalized, making me think this is Whimsy's magic helping her with her drawing, which she does purely for her own enjoyment. Meanwhile, the Alethi are a very warlike people who enjoy fighting, so that same Investiture (just manifested in a different way), could apply to them as a culture in order to help them fight and win in wars.

Another is that I thought the shards of broken pottery at the end of WoA were actual capital-S Shards, but Mistborn Era 1 was my intro to the Cosmere, and this was back when I had just heard the term Shard outside of the books and didn't really know what they were. I dropped the theory in a few pages.

A couple theories I'm proud of are [this one about Kabsal working for the Ghostbloods](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/comments/10qhz0r/i_kid_you_not_this_came_to_me_in_a_dream_theory/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1), and [this one about the Parshendi coming back to life in the same way as the Heralds](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/comments/10tsr8a/first_time_reading_wok_theory_about_the_parshendi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1), both during my first read of TWOK.

But in Yumi, Hoid makes a passing note that

>The darkness [the Shroud] was strangely transparent to her. (And she didn’t even have to burn tin.)

(page 443 if you care)

this implies that a Tineye on Komashi (Painters Planet) would also be able to see through the Shroud.

To me this sounds like a Tineye's real ability is the ability to see through investiture based obscurements.

However, if that is the case. Then a Tineye would also be able to see through a Lightweaving (atleast a Rosharan one) as they are made of pure investiture. This would give Tineyes a substantial utility boost if true.

With Elantris, there was something about what was going on and why it was happening and how things came to be that got to me. With The Final Empire, I'm not sure why but I wanted answered immediately and felt like Brandon could have given us the world building background sooner than he did. Other books do a good job, but it does take me a while before I really care about what's going on. 

With TWoK, Brandon immediately captures your attention with the prologue and opening chapter before giving us our main leads.

Recently read a comment on a FB group about how Brandon Sanderson's stated that Kaladin at the 3rd Ideal would probably beat Kelsier, and given that Vasher toyed with Kaladin during their spar we can assume that Vasher would also beat Kelsier.

However, I read WARBREAKER fairly recently and Vasher didn't seem all that powerful, I swear he struggled to take down 20 or 30 normal soldiers mixed with Awakened golems and that was using Nightblood. Outside of the Emperor nobody seemed all that powerful on the scale of the Cosmere. Yeah Vasher beat Kaladin but Kaladin wasn't using his powers to the fullest extent and Vasher had the element of suprise because Kaladin didn't know about his Breaths. 

Kelsier on the other hand has been shown to basically be able to disregard normal soldiers and beat an Inquisitor, which is basically a death sentence to anyone other than Vin. Surely if Kelsier were burning pewter and making full use of iron and steel and pushing on Vasher's anger (which has been shown to be a massive liability for Vasher) Kelsier would wipe the floor with him?",1688728881.0

Did the ending to The Secret History hurt for anyone else?,243,14sjmua,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14sjmua/did_the_ending_to_the_secret_history_hurt_for/,46,"So, I've just about finished my read of everything in the Cosmere to date. I started with Stormlight, and pivoted to Mistborn era 1 directly after. Since then has been everything else. So, there has been quite a bit of distance between Elend and Vin's story for me timewise. 

The ending of Era 1 struck me as both one of the best, yet also one of the most tragic endings of any of Sanderson's work put out so far. Something about the finality of Vin and Elend's sacrifice was deeply touching - yet, in Sazed's note he mentions speaking to them and how they are happy and resting for a time. I interpreted that as them living on to some degree in the cognitive realm. 

Last night I finished the Secret History, and it felt a bit like re-opening a wound when Elend and Vin very briefly address Kelsier, then let themselves be drawn into The Beyond.  Vin's parting words about love to Keslier also stung quite a bit, in a bittersweet kind of way. 

The fact that Vin and Elend are well and truly gone (as dead as dead can seem to get in the Cosmere) really surprised me in how much it hurt for a minute. In many ways it really ended up feeling like losing the characters all over again, just completely this time.

Allomancy and Intent,2,14tf1w1,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14tf1w1/allomancy_and_intent/,3,"The title talks about allomancy but in reality this post is more speculation and questions about Intent and what I'll call the Cosmere Metamagics, things like Intent and Spiritwebs and whatnot. For reference I've read Mistborn Era 1, Mistborn: Secret History, The Way of Kings, Words of Radiance, Edgedancer and Warbreaker, currently about 60% of the way through Oathbringer. I will try to tag spoilers but I might miss some, so if there's something you haven't read proceed with caution :p

TL;DR. Does allomancy require intent or will an allomancer be able to use their powers anywhere anyways? Final Empire Vin points towards the latter being true, but her having knowledge about allomancy (that is to say she basically knew it existed) might muddy that conclusion. If, however, it is the case, how does Intent and other metamagics actually work and interact with the different types of Investiture through the Cosmere?

So, this post was born as a literal shower thought, I was thinking about Intent and how it interacts with different types of Investiture and magic; mainly in regards to healing, which, as far as I know, doesn't so much heal in a literal sense but rather aligns the physiscal aspect of a beign with their perceived self-image, hence why in WoR >!Lopen gets his arm back but Kaladin doesn't erase the Shash or let the tattoo stick. It might be subconscious, but something about how he sees himself doesn't let the physical modifications manifest, which has some *really sad* implications but whatever!<

I then started thinking about hemalurgy. Now I technically *know* that hemalurgy requires intent as per the 17th Shard wiki, to quote:
""Hemalurgy can be used anywhere in the Cosmere, as long as there is an Intent to create a Hemalurgic spike.""

There, clear as crystal, shanking two dudes in the streets of Kharbranth with an iron knife wont give the second one the first's strength. However, that's literally what happen with Spook during The Hero of Ages. I'm a bit muddy on the details because it was a while ago, but, if I remember correctly, he was fighting a couple Pewter mistings, one of them got killed and then a shard from that sword got stuck on Spook's shoulder, giving him the power of the misting >!and Ruin a way into his mind!< I'm either missing something or this is a plothole, whether it was Spook or the other misting who created the hemalurgic spike doesn't matter because neither of them would know what that is (hemalurgy being a closely guarded secret of The Lord Ruler) and if hemalurgy requires intent then neither of them should have been able to create the spike. I honestly don't even have a theory for this, I'm just confused.

Finally it came to allomancy, the hypothetical scenario goeth thusly. If a mistborn were to go to Nalthis, for example, and start a bloodline there, could one of their descendants snap and, like Vin, use their allomancy even if they didn't know what it was or how to actually use it. There are a couple problems with this scenario, mainly the fact that a single mistborn diluted over possibly centuries would have a real hard time producing an allomancer, let alone a mistborn, but for the sake of the theory lets assume that this nalthian mistborn has no problem being born. If they have no problem using their allomancy then that would point towards it not needing intent, but why? Does it have something to do with the internal nature of allomancy vs the external nature of hemalurgy? If that's the case then how would it work with feruchemy? Which magics are affected by intent and which are not? And, I guess more importantly, what determines each one?

I don't know if this is all just senseless jabbering on my part or if this will end up just being a RAFO kinda thing, but I wanted to put these questions out there, maybe talk it out with fellow fans yknow :p

Question on Dalinar's Potential (SP3 Spoiler),8,14ry70d,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14ry70d/question_on_dalinars_potential_sp3_spoiler/,3," 

Question about Dalinar and his potential as a Bondsmith.

Bondsmith's powers are on another level, somewhat akin to the power being concentrated in only being 3 of them instead of an undefined number of knights radiants. Dalinar repairs a temple wall somewhat routinely in Oathbringer Chapter 59. The Coppermind mentions Bondsmith's ability to use Tension as specifically an ability to repair inanimate objects.

Dalinar also seems to have an ability to tap directly into some maximum amount of investiture possible via summoning honor's perpendicularity.

It seems not unreasonable that Dalinar could reform Honor as a functionally complete Shard this way, and one could also assume he would claim it (although there are a number of possible/interesting characters to do that). I assume the Shard of Honor is an inanimate object? And Tanavast is dead, and to the best of my knowledge nothing revealed so far states Odium could (should he want to, we really don't know the deal/terms of his imprisonment) stop such a thing (and Odium, at least, seems to have a blind spot even with his Fortune for some investiture events and invested items, like Honor's perpendicularity being formed and Nightblood).

Spur of the moment question, what stops Dalinar from losing the contest, still becoming Honor, but also being Honorbound? to serve Odium? As I understand, the word of a Shard binds them entirely (which may infact be the foundation of Odium's imprisonment, that he gave his word in exchange for something...like being able to kill Tanavast). That would set up quite the expanding Cosmere conflict, a reluctant but obligated Dalinar on the ""bad"" team.

Along those lines, what else could he repair? Could he put Dominion and Devotion back together, or Virtuosity in the future (in the right conditions, given)? Could this power bind or repair shards against their will (or the will of splinters in case of a shattered Shard), considering they all have basically unlimited power but demonstrate an ability to hurt/change one another in the right circumstances? Would this eventually included an ability to reform Adonalsium, against anyone's or Shard's will or not?

Tangent question, are there any WOB that cover the possibility that the large brooding conflict isn't driven by awakened things that have grown outside anyone's capability to govern? Given how easy it was for a poorly thought out machine to do it in SP3, it seems like such a short step for it to be used in an intentionally power hungry way. The Men of Gold seem like the least of the possibilities. Someone in the right mindset and power could awaken a machine along the lines of ""seek out and destroy all life, and amass the power to do so.""

A thought on Awakening Commands,87,14rdvzz,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14rdvzz/a_thought_on_awakening_commands/,33,"So I'm sitting here listening to Stormlight for the millionth time and I had a thought on the nature of Nightblood. Now I consider myself something of a baby worldhopper; I've read and listened to the entirety of the Cosmere minus the secret projects and I'm familiar with the Coppermind and WoBs. That being said, I don't have a whole lot I don't have a whole lot of time for researching theories, so I'm hoping y'all might be able to set me straight if I'm wrong. 

Ok, so Nightblood. We know that to Awaken something we need three things: breath, a Command, and most importantly Intent. In smaller awakenings the command and intent have to be pretty much perfectly in line...unless you use more breath. Increased investiture can ""fill in the gaps"" between command and intent. So it follows that the more investiture that gets poured in increases the size of the gaps between the two that can be filled, meaning large investiture Awakenings like awakening metal can have more ambiguous commands and still work. I think this is largely why Nightblood did not work the way the scholars thought it would. 

Here's my theory, Shashara thought investiture as a whole was bad, or at least the source of a lot of corruption throughout the Cosmere. I think that mindset corrupted her intent when making Nightblood. So while her command was ""Destroy Evil"" the intent became ""Destroy Investiture"". Even though they're not perfectly in line, there's enough investiture involved in the awakening that the command still takes, thus creating the most potent weapon in the Cosmere. 

This is why Nightblood has such a hard time understanding evil. Everything is invested at least a little bit, whether through creation by a Shard or by Adonalsium itself (not sure where I'm getting that from, but it makes sense in my head).  So Nightblood sees everything as evil because of Shashara's intent. This is also why Nightblood steals the color from whatever it cuts because color is so ingrained in the magic of its home system. 

Anywho, that's about all I can get into right now because of work, but I'm hoping my fellow hoppers could take a look at this and tell me if I'm crazy or not. Is it possible that there is a faction opposite the ghost bloods that are actually trying to get rid of investiture altogether?",1688570838.0

As would make the most dramatic sense, we finally follow Gavilar on the night of his own assassination, having followed numerous characters who interacted with him  before. In those previous books, each meeting would add a ton of context and establish some important things of the book to come, as well as make Gavilar himself more and more complicated a character, building this web of conspiracy and influence around him, and building his goals up to be greater and greater.

Come this chapter, the big revelations we get are pretty much that he was a poser, a bigger dick than we thought from before, that he actually lacked a lot of knowledge, was actively messing up a lot, was wrong about plenty of obvious things, and that his main goal was to just be immortal then be king forever that way. It is surprisingly underwhelming both in potential thematics terms and immediate information.

If I’m looking charitably at this I think the biggest takeaway might’ve been the suggestion that there is more to the stormfather than meets the eye, but the entire thing is again kinda underwhelming. Maybe a deeper reading might confirm that Gavilar himself was incredibly susceptible or was partly corrupted by odium in wanting pretty much to make a forever, really big war sorta like odium alludes to is the better option at least because otherwise the stormfather is completely right in saying that he was affected too hard by his upbringing in alethi religious ideas.

Dark Souls in Cosmere



The Cosmere, created by author Brandon Sanderson, is a shared universe in which several of his fantasy series take place. While Dark Souls is not directly part of the Cosmere, we can explore how it could potentially fit into the cosmology and themes of Sanderson's universe. Here are some points to consider:

Shardic Influence: In the Cosmere, the Shardic Intents shape the worlds and influence the magic systems. Dark Souls could be considered a world with its own Shard, representing concepts like despair, perseverance, or even death. This Shard's power would affect the world and its inhabitants, driving the themes of the game.

Realmatic Theory: The Cosmere operates on the concept of realms and their interactions. Dark Souls could have its own unique realm, perhaps a dark and twisted version of one of the realms like the Cognitive or Spiritual Realm. This realm would be closely tied to the themes of darkness, suffering, and rebirth that are prevalent in Dark Souls.

Magic System Integration: Dark Souls' unique magic system, based on souls and their manipulation, could be adapted to fit the Cosmere's Investiture-based magic systems. Souls in Dark Souls could be seen as a specific form of Investiture, giving users access to unique powers and abilities.

Worldhopping and Interactions: Within the Cosmere, there are individuals known as worldhoppers who travel between different planets and realms. Dark Souls could introduce characters who possess the ability to travel between worlds, bridging the gap between the Dark Souls universe and the Cosmere. These worldhoppers might bring their knowledge and abilities from other Cosmere worlds, adding a layer of depth to the Dark Souls lore.

Epic Scale and Conflict: The Cosmere is known for its epic scope and conflicts between powerful entities. Dark Souls, with its grand scale battles against colossal beings and its emphasis on challenging gameplay, could easily fit into this theme. The bosses and ancient beings in Dark Souls could be seen as representations of Invested entities or even Shards themselves.

Philosophical Themes: Both Dark Souls and the Cosmere explore deep philosophical themes. Dark Souls delves into existential questions, the nature of humanity, and the struggle against fate. These philosophical underpinnings would resonate with the themes explored in the Cosmere, adding depth and complexity to the overall cosmology.",1688660898.0

Question about the heralds,12,14qpmi2,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14qpmi2/question_about_the_heralds/,6,"So I'm a fairly new reader to the Cosmere. I've read Mistborn Era 1, and am nearing the end of Words of Radiance. I've fallen in love with the universe and have purchased all the books in the Cosmere for future reading. I've also been getting some lore videos on YouTube and tiktok, plus the occasional suggested post here on reddit, which leads me to a big question I have for the Stormlight Archive. 

I've tried to avoid spoilers as a whole, but I've seen mentioned several times that the heralds are guiding certain things in the story. There was a post on this subreddit earlier today/yesterday mentioning that one of the heralds was with Amaram when he murdered Kaladins men since Kaladin didn't take the shardblade he won, and I saw a lore video on tiktok talking about Shallans mom being rumored to be a herald. My question is: is this information that will eventually be given to me in the future Stormlight books, is it info I've missed picking up on, or is it something I'm supposed to intuit? I have trouble keeping all of the little details in my head with these books since they're so info dense, so it's possible I could have missed something. I'm not looking for full explanations or anything, I just want to confirm that I haven't missed something, and that I should just be patient for the info to come to me naturally.",1688501529.0

What I love about Secret Projects is the way they HUMANIZE Hoid. I feel like when you are reading Stormlight, Mistborn, or any other Cosmere book, you think about Hoid as some sort of omniscient god. Someone powerful that was born knowing everything in the Cosmere. Someone always confident and all-knowing who helps the confused hero. Nothing bad could ever happen to Hoid, right? Yet, in these books we see him STRUGGLE (in a certain way), we see him face Cosmere threats he doesn't know about and we see him overcome them. We see him vulnerable yet confident. It really paints a new picture on how I see Hoid. A really, really, intelligent scholar, yet a human nonetheless.",1688422074.0

This even includes one person in particular that doesn’t hop but still interacts remotely with other worlds using a different name. 

While I can see valid story reasons for a few characters to hide their identity, it seems a little strange that they all do.

Which Secret Project has your favorite art so far?,15,14pjjwn,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14pjjwn/which_secret_project_has_your_favorite_art_so_far/,22,"This is a hard question for me so I was curious about other people's thoughts especially since each book has such a different style. The other struggle is that each different style fits their respective books so well. 

Tress' art might be the most consistent for me where I like just about every single art piece in it. It really helped add to the whole fairytale vibe and the painting with Charlie and Tress at the beginning really helped bring the characters alive to me and helped me visualize their happy relationship together so well. But then you got to see the spores eat the ship, the dragon, Hoid vs the sorceress and so on that were all just perfect key moments as well as worldbuilding moments. 

The Frugal Wizard's art was just so perfect since it was as over the top as the in world frugal wizard book. The struggle is that how do you compare art meant to be straight up beautiful like in Tress and Yumi and the Nightmare Painter with art meant more to entertain and make you laugh. So while I loved the art in this book, I think I just prefer art that is very picturesque, although that's not to say that the Frugal Wizard's art was bad. Its other advantage was just the sheer amount of art in it with the art telling its own little story in the margins. 

Yumi and The Nightmare Painter's art was a little hit or miss for me honestly. I think the style threw me just a little and some of the pieces like Painter painting the bamboo felt a bit meh for me. But then you get art with Yumi collapsed after stacking stones which was great but later the full color spread of Yumi in the trees with the butterflies was just gorgeous. I could understand how Painter would feel like that scene stood out to him as a painter. 

So in some ways its a toss up for me between Tress and Yumi and The Nightmare Painter. I might lean towards Yumi and The Nightmare Painter but that might just be recency bias and I haven't looked at it as much as I have with the art for Tress. But what do y'all think about the art and whether you have a favorite?",1688392124.0

Previously I’ve seen it recommended to start with Elantris because it’s a great book, easy to understand, and is a good intro to Brandon’s writing style. Would you say the same now that Tress is out? I feel like Tress hits all the same notes and has the advantage of Brandon having a ton more experience so the prose is much better (not that Elantris is terrible or anything). 

The only issue I see with Tress is that is written from Hoid’s PoV and it could be jarring when he pulls you out of the story to talk about himself or other things if you don’t understand him as a character from previous Cosmere interactions.

Shallan. I absolutely despise this/these character(s). I love the idea of MPD, it's an amazing premise and I think Sandiboi writes it very well. The whole idea of why she has it and uses it to her advantage is amazing. But I hate the whole Spy/Stealth sort of approach she has.

Everyone has their niche, Delinar has his political angle (which I've been skipping his flashbacks about his wife and just reading the first page and last to get the jist.) Kaladin is the GOAT and gets the action and the roots of the army angle, and Shallan gets her cool secret agent blending in with different crowds and trying to get info.

I love Stealth missions in video games, and I generally liked Mistborn which had elements of stealth in it. But, I don't know, I do not like Shallan chapters at all.

Most OP Twinborn + Radiant combos,50,14nsufb,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14nsufb/most_op_twinborn_radiant_combos/,19,"I love making up insane power combos so I’d like to give some of my suggestions and see what people could come up with in the comments

1) Speedy Gonzales: Edgedancer + A-Pewter/F-Steel

You’d have insane coordination and grace from the A-Pewter and speed from the F-Steel, while negating air resistance with Abrasion so you could run at full tilt without burning up. 

You could even use Progression to heal quickly if you ever slam into anything (a spike for F-Zinc might help but that seems too much)

2) Corruptor: Duralumin Compounder + Surge of Transformation

I wonder if a character could mimic Raboniel in ROW and Corrupt spren using their compounded Connection to either Preservation or Ruin. They’d need to be either an Elsecaller, Willshaper, or spike a fannahn-im. Might let them bond a spren despite having Hemalurgic spikes (I read somewhere that spren probably wouldn’t bond a Hemalurgist)

3) Chameleon: Lightweaver + A-Iron/F-Zinc

As a Lightweaver, could completely cloak themselves and depend on ironsight to see and move around, using their F-Zinc to constantly adjust and perfect their cloaking so no-one could see them coming

4) On-Fire Wrecking Ball: Skybreaker + A-Duralumin/F-Iron

Could Duralumin-burn Division to incinerate entire swaths of land or hires of enemies, or Duralumin-burn Gravitation on a huge object to launch it at enemies.

A niche use could be tapping their F-Iron and Lashing themselves at a target to crash into them with tons of force and absolutely shred them

spoiler alert for  mistborn ,now thet we got thet out of the way please no spoilers to the books i haven't read in the comments  . 

this post is about mistborn secret history (till now arguably the most cosmere relevant book i have read .)  in  this book sanderson showed us  his amazing planning skills  for example : 

when vin almost met hoid she got a dangerous vibe from him in  the hero of all age's and in secret history (eight years later publishing wise ) we finally got to know why , tnx to my boy kelsier , another hint or foreshadowing we got in hero of all ages was on spook's end when kelsier , told him  "" i called you my friend , wasn't that enough "" in secret history we got to experience the same story from a different preceptive. 

we got a dose of poetic irony when kelsier imitated  ruin much like ruin imitated kelsier  , on top of this we got lore drops and hoid goodness .

hell for ones  it seemed like hoid's personality was similar to wit in stormlight archive  , was this personality , one of his fake's or did he finally drop the pretense? (i think its his real personality )

anyway it was a great book , to be honest in my opinion mistborn era 1 is the best among cosmere books even better thene stormlight archive .

btw i didn't skip the order its just i found the order to late  , what do you think of the order ?  (personally i would have bumped secret history to after hero of ages before alloy of law , and i would have placed elantris before mistborn cause going from good to less good is kind of jarring and annoying  )",1688149542.0

He said, roughly, the same thing. Saying that, if he stopped pretending like all Noblemen were monsters or that they were people just like Skaa, then he had to admit that he was the monster for killing so many of them.

FTL travel with time bubbles,16,14maaa6,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14maaa6/ftl_travel_with_time_bubbles/,18,"So I was thinking about the space age of the Cosmere when people can use spaceships to travel between planets instead of Shadesmar, and naturally one issue that comes with any such story is how do you travel between planets in a reasonable time scale without breaking the laws of physics. Some stories pretty much hand-wave this, but I doubt that Brandon will do so because of his focus on in-world consistency as well as all the magic technology at his disposal.

It's been implied that Scadrial is the first planet to achieve space travel, which makes sense because Allomancy is the one magic system we've seen that specifically deals with altering the passage of time, specifically with Cadmium and Bendalloy bubbles. Before I get to the main theory, I just want to say that this will require some technological and/or magical advances, such as larger time bubbles with a more extreme temporal affect, that can also stay tethered to the motion of a spaceship. But when you consider how fast magical technologies are already moving on Scadrial, such as with the Malwish airships, I think it's reasonable to assume that in a couple hundred years they will have enough control over allomancy to produce these effects.

Neither Cadmium nor Bendalloy will work by themselves. Bendalloy will get the ship there quickly, but everyone inside will have aged several lifetimes (assuming there's no cryogenic sleep involved). Cadmium will allow the crew/passengers to travel in a reasonable time, but once you get to the other side you will be way too far in the future, Planet of the Apes style. But we do know that overlapping bubbles of each metal cancel out, and this could be used to great effect. Imagine a large Bendalloy bubble that encompasses the ship and a decent amount of empty space around it, that travels along with the ship. Now imagine a smaller Cadmium bubble that also encompasses the ship, but not the empty space around it, and this one also travels with the ship in a way that it is always inside of the Bendalloy bubble. Everything inside the larger bubble, (including the smaller bubble) will travel extremely quickly when viewed from the outside, allowing it to cross interstellar distances in a short amount of time. But to those inside of the smaller bubble, time will still be moving normally. So lets say that to someone outside of these bubbles in an objective frame of reference, such as someone on one of the planets, a few month pass. To the space inside the larger bubble though, centuries have passed while traveling at high speeds, allowing it to travel all the way from one planet to another. But if you go farther inside to the people on the spaceship itself, a few months have passed, same as the objective frame reference. But because they were still technically inside the fast moving bubble, they have been able to cross lightyears of space and get to another planet.

This is just a random idea I came up with today, so I don't know if it would actually work, or if someone else has already had this idea. Based on what I know of allomancy I think it should work. But please let me know if there's some reason it won't work, or if there's any improvements you guys would make. ",1688058067.0

Earlier there is a scene where a physician notes how scared his body is and how he shouldn't be able to move as he does. ""That's not how it works"" they say, when he argues he trained himself back to fitness.

This implies that stormlight may be what's been keeping him alive through his years of fighting.

How was he doing this without a spren though? He hadn't bonded Stormdaddy yet so wouldn't have said the first oath, he wouldn't have been a squire to any radiant and he didn't have an Oathblade.

Is there another way you can use stormlight?",1688064360.0

So i wanted to try and get a boost out there to any aspiring cosmere readers new to the franchise, if you like what im saying please upvote.

Sanderson put a lot of work into making sure his stories are self contained if you read a series like mistborn or the stormlight archive you can totally just read that series, the same goes for his stand alones. There is no required reading for any other related books, the Caveat here is this is a joined universe and there is some crossover between series, mostly through cameo's or better context to how the magic system works. 

Knowing who a character is before you read the original story has the potential to undermine the plot of the very story you are reading. Im sure many veterens know who im talking about. 

I will finish by showing my original natural reading order before discovering there was a greater cosmere. 

Misborn era 1 books 1,2,3  - secret history - era 2 books 1. (This is when i found out the stories were interconnected in the background and it spurred me on to discover the secrets myself) 2 &3.  Stormlight archive books 1,2,3,4. Edgedancer, warbreaker, elantris, dawnshard, the lost metal.

I found by missing parts of the behind the scenes story it led my curiosity to seek those answers and encouraged me to read and subsequently enjoy books id otherwise not like as much, and in turn hooked me on rereads and seeking out other details id missed. 

Sometimes the answers aren't easy to find but seeking them out is extremely satisfying!",1687831322.0

I think this is will lead to an interesting conflict. I think that the avatars and other shards of Autonomy will rebel against her because they want more autonomy. Because the Intent of the Shard is in line with her avatars instead of with Autonomy herself, she will be heavily restricted in the fight and will get shredded.

- the lady judge requires the second vote to be unanimous, but only because a first vote had already been cast that was deemed invalid.

- according to the lord merchant, the lady judge is aware of the large amount of money that the sand masters are owed by the lord merchant. How does she complain about the financial perspective then? I understand she might be sworn to secrecy, but again - from a legal perspective, the sandmasters are financially incredibly well off, and the reason is because they legally deposited money others gave them, not some unlawful scheme.

Some thoughts about Warbreaker and faith/religion,33,14jgax3,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14jgax3/some_thoughts_about_warbreaker_and_faithreligion/,9,"\[SPOILERS about the ending of Warbreaker\]

Hey! Just finished reading Warbreaker, my sixth Cosmere book (also read Mistborn first trilogy, Wax & Wayne book 1 and Elantris; going for The Way of Kings now).

Honestly, I thougth I wouldn't like Warbreaker as much as I did. Maybe it was because I didn't like Elantris very much (good story, great world building, but not so good writing and pacing), which made me think Sanderson's standalones were not great.

I'm happy I was wrong. Really liked Warbreaker! Its magic system is amazing, although confusing as hell sometimes, and the characters were pretty much all great (specially Vivenna, Vasher and Lightsong).

It got me thinking about how Sanderson uses faith and religion to move through the story and develop the characters. The two characters that stand out the most to me in this aspect are Vivenna and Lightsong.

On one side, you have a strict princess who has her faith put to test and finishes the book leaving her religion behind, because she understands many things she believed were not true or not so relevant to her. On the other side, a literal god who doesn't believe the religion he is a part of, but, in the end, accepts his godhood and uses it to do something good.

In both cases, their life experiences forced them to change their perspective about their faith. And I think this really resonates with real life. To me, believing in God or not, having a religion, having faith in something... it all depends on what you've been through and how your life was lived.

I, for instance, am an atheist (since I was 14; I'm 30 now). Until then, however, I went from catholic to protestant and to LSD church. Baptized in all of these churches, even. But God just never happened to me. Religion is simply not a part of my life, it doesn't matter to me, I don't care about it. That is something I learned with time and what makes sense to me.

Anyway, I just wanted to show Warbreaker some love and say that Sanderson really does a great job on depicting how one can come to terms with a personal faith/religion, even completely changing perspective if they need to. Great book! On to The Way of Kings now.",1687783356.0

As was stated previously on this forum, the investment classifications are as follows:

Type 1: Investiture Made Sentient (more or less) like Spren and Seons. 

Type 2: Invested organic sentient entity, like the returned or cognitive shadows.

Type 3: Invested organic non-sentient entity, like lifeless.

Type 4: Invested non-organic non-sentient entity, awakened ropes or other objects.

Type 5: Invested non-organic sentient entity, Nightblood.

So:

From the way I see it most end-positive (and possibly end-neutral) forms of Investment temporarily turn the user into a Type 2 Invested Entity. The best examples of this would be Surgebinding and Allomancy (and MAYBE Feruchemy). People from Nalthis with Breaths would also be considered Type 2 Entities. 

I know that Type 2 has almost always been described as pretty much just Returned, of which I do still think this theory allows. I’d consider that the practitioners of these arts are simply TEMPORARILY becoming Type 2, while a full fledged Returned / Herald is CONSISTENTLY Type 2. I think that the fact that Surgebinders automatically begging to heal themselves when investing Stormlight into themselves further supports this notion.

"When people talk about Cosmere adaptations, I think we are thinking too small",42,14ioh8n,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14ioh8n/when_people_talk_about_cosmere_adaptations_i/,34,"Brandon has lofty plans for the cosmere comparing his goals for his legacy to Stan Lee. I believe he can achieve this but only if he plays the long game. 

When selecting a production studio, he needs to think about reach and marketing power but also lasting legacy. 

In order to enter the level of cultural zeitgeist that Brandon aspires to will make his work at the cultural level of Star Wars, Marvel, and the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. And what is one thing that all of these major IPs have in common? 

Theme park lands! The truth is that there are only two major players in the themed entertainment industry, Disney and Universal. When we assess the Disney park brand it has five major brands; Princesses, Star Wars, Marvel, Avatar, and Pixar. When we look at Universal parks, it has Nintendo, Minions, Harry Potter, Universal Monsters, Jurassic Park, and Dreamworks. 

Which of these brands would the characters of the cosmere blend better with? Once you take out the animation studios and compare Star Wars, MCU, and Avatar against Potter, Monsters, and Jurassic, one is clearly darker with more adult themes. Universal

The other factor isn’t whether the cosmere can fit in their pantheon but if there is room on their team that hasn’t already been filled by another IP. The cosmere is hard magic system high fantasy but also someday a space opera. As such neither park has a high fantasy IP but Universal does have Potter as a low fantasy IP. But Disney has Avatar and Star Wars as science fiction and space opera respectively. I believe that the cosmere would fit better at the Universal parks long term. 

One benefit is that Universal does license out their IPs from Nintendo and Warner Brothers for Mario and Potter respectively. So the cosmere doesn’t need to be produced by Universal. Paramount, Netflix, or Warners are all partners that Universal has worked with before. Though I’m sure negotiations for parks would be easier if it was a Universal production. 

Universal won’t just build a land for the cosmere on a whim. But the cosmere can begin integrating into the parks early in its adaptation. How? Halloween Horror Nights, the largest Halloween event with 10 houses and multiple scare zones. Previous IPs at HHN include: Universal Monsters, Walking Dead, Stranger Things to comedies like Beetlejuice and Ghostbusters. 

A few months to a year after Mistborn hits theaters, Universal can do a Mistborn house for a season to test interest. Imagine: HHN’s signature fog is pumped out as the mist as you enter Kredik Shaw with Kelsier and Vin. Inquisitors pop out at every turn, you watch the conflict between Kelsier and the Lord Ruler. Further years could have Kandra and mistwraiths, Koloss, and Zane. The merch would be amazing too, the coins, mist cloaks, and whatever else. 

(I think Shadows for Silence would be a great house too down the road.)

We all know it would be a hit. So what next? I’m tempted to say Stormlight but I actually think Silverlight would be a good amalgam of all the worlds. 

The flight hard magic systems in both Stormlight and Mistborn would make for amazing coasters: Coinshot, Windrunner, Skybreaker. Imagine a coaster through the high storm witnessing Kaladin and Szeth’s battle at the end of Words of Radiance. 

Every good theme-park land needs great food; Chouta, Hoid’s instant noodles both quickly come to mind. 

In conclusion, I honestly don’t care what studio produces the adaptations so long as Universal gets the theme park rights. Brandon deserves to enter the nerd creator pantheon along side Stan Lee, Steven Spielberg, and George Lucas by having his creation immortalized not just in film but physically in a park. And he will, we will all help get him there.",1687705427.0
How much influence do Shards/Shardholeers have on their respective magic system?,24,14iqq4u,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14iqq4u/how_much_influence_do_shardsshardholeers_have_on/,10,"Basically the question- how much influence do the shards/holders have over their respective magic systems, if any. 

Did the extra part of himself Preservation placed in the people of Scadrial enable the ability of allomancy? Or was it allomancy itself he placed as the extra piece - or was this an unintended side effect when this happened? (Just realised second half of this is potentially wrong as allomancy was extremely rare until TLR ate lerasium at WOA)

Did Honor deliberately create the spren with the Nahel bond in mind, so that spren who deemed humans/singers worthy could bond and give them access to surgebinding? Did he choose and create the surges to some extent? 

Did Autonomy on Taldain( only read arcanum unbounded excerpt of white sand), deliberately invest the sand and choose for some of those people to be able to shape it?

Were Breaths created by Endowment, or did Breaths come to exist due to Endowment being around on the planet so long?

Tried to get into the mistborn series but it's not for me. A few questions about Tress' world in case it's explained in other books.

1. Wont twelve moons constantly raining spores down onto a planet eventually submerge any land mass? It makes sense that there are seemingly only islands mentioned in the book and no continents.
Like do older spores eventually die? But wont the remains build up under the sea overtime anyway?

2. Where does water come from? Bc even if there are rivers, underground springs etc it would still need to follow the natural ecosystem of sea, rain, river and then back to sea. That said where does their sewage go?

3. Assuming there is wind in Tress' world if a sand storm blows then I guess it's byebye to anyone staying remotely close by. Unless every island is fully equipped with silver

4. Also if there are 12 moons (ignoring the gravitational catastrophe that should come with such a thing) wouldn't the planet be in constant orbit? If the planet does orbit  why are the seas even separated? Shouldnt the whole planet sea + landmass, be totally peppered with all types of spores from the constant change of lunar phases? Nothing would survive

I apologize if some of these are dumb questions, but I'm slow to pick up on cosmere wide continuity…

What was “The Lost Metal”?  Harmonium?  We knew that existed.

Did Wax become a full mistborn by the end?  Harmony was circumspect about whether Wax “Inhaled” the lerasium after the experiment.

II Wax inhaled it, why did no one else that was in the room?

What was different about the process that Wax did to separate Harmonium that allowed the creation of Lerasium and Atrium?

By the end, they said Marsh was going to be fine because the Malwish was able to find some Atium dust in the remnants of Wax’s experiment.  Wouldn’t Marsh need ALOT more Atium to compound it?  Would “dust” really be enough?

Have we seen anything about the “soldiers of gold and red” before?  They seemed familiar?

Moonlight was Shai from the emperor’s soul right?  How did she get out into the cosmere?

I have never been able to get into Elantris....is there a “Cliffs notes” version I can get the story from?

Moonlight changed her “soul” to an actual Elantrian?  According to the Wiki, she has a few more of those?

Who drained the bands of mourning?  They mentioned over and over that it was some sort of “ploy” by the malwish…

Ok, I’m pretty sure that I completely forgot about book 3….I assume Kelsier had a spike in order to “pin” his soul to his body…where did he get the body?

Wow. Went in completely blind to anything Sanderson and was blown away. You all know that feeling after you finish a great book… just needed to voice some thoughts and eagerly wait other thoughts in return. 

I’m so bought into this whole cosmere thing (this is my first entry of Sanderson). Obviously I’m very late to the party but was hoping to hear others thoughts, experiences, and overall impressions of the way of kings. Kind of hard to find non stormlight or cosmere spoiler discussion and to be honest I’m too scared to dig deep. 

Some quick thoughts I had  (I will get names wrong because I audiobooked it, fantastic by the way). 

Kalidans journey was fucking awesome. Him jumping off the bridge during the last battle and sucking up the stormlight from the beards of the parshende, and then becoming a larger than life OP spearman was the best. I would kill to see this animated or acted out. 

He Killed a fucking shardbearer with nothing but a spear. My god. One of my favorite characters ever. The bridge crew was just great. Can’t wait to see what he does with surge binding. Seems a fight with szeth is somewhere down the line. 


I love jasnah so much. The respect to deny established religion in a place everyone believes, but never forcing her ideas on others… great character. I absolutely loved the end when her and shallan are finally honest and start getting into the meat of jasnahs quest.



Related to jasmah, I thought it was witty the all mighty ended up being real - although it seems to me he isn’t as much of a “god” as more likely a being from a far advanced civilization who knows where or when. The dalinar vision at the end was fucking awesome. Gave me chills. 


I just love the overall vibe, mystery, and world of roshar. 

Loved the fact the szeth is this mass murdering, king slaying, force of destruction and violence and yet he absolutely fucking hates all of it. I loved his perspective. And surge binding is fucking cool. The little lashing details, like a quarter lash upwards gives half weight, awesome. 


Also the carbranth king being an underground mastermind is really cool, and my god does he seem to know a lot. Loved the mystery all book of the prophetic dying words of random citizens. Cool to see that come together In the end. I’m assuming dalinar won’t survive the series but fuck, hearing him be the next name on szeths list hurts. Very interested in these seemingly opposing forces -  both want to save Roshar but must be opposed in some way. 


Fkn sadius. I do love his and dalinars conversation after the betrayal. I thought Sadius made some actually interesting points about why he betrayed him. I liked that he was honest and didn’t seem to harbor any actual hate. 


Speaking of - dalinar giving his shard blade for the bridge men, and Kalidan finally having that moment of “holy fuck, this light eyes actually did it” was so cathartic. I love dalinar. I love his family. I think the younger brother will have a bigger part to play, may be the biggest of his family. 

Very excited to learn more about Wit. He is obviously a much more important character than seemed most of the book. I loved the scene of him and kalidan talking and his story about the king sailing west. Also the scene at the end of the book, him “waiting for the storm” 

One little detail I always chuckled at was different characters ways of saying “lord have mercy”. Blood of my fathers, storm father, Kalaks breath, etc etc 

I could go on and on. So many epic quotes, great conversations, and mysteries.

Couple of questions: 

These have probably answered so many times but I’m so scared of spoilers. 

I’m already on to warbreaker. By all accounts reading this between WoK and WoR is massive: but the real questions is how do I attack the rest of the cosmere? 

I obviously don’t want to break up SA - I’m cool with the novellas and single books like WB, but I wouldn’t want to move to MB or anything because I’m so enthralled by SA. Do you lose anything reading the cosmere out of order? 

And What exactly is the cosmere or should I even know that yet? From the little I’ve gathered it’s basically a shared solar system. Would it help to understand anything more than that at this point? 

Last thing - did we ever find out what the words gavalar had szeth write out meant? Something to the effect of “find the most important words a man can say”?

Have you ever noticed the similarities between Mistborn and Sonic and the Black Knight?,0,14hezad,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14hezad/have_you_ever_noticed_the_similarities_between/,1,"Hey, longtime lurker, first time poster. 

This was something I noticed recently and I thought y’all may be interested. I don’t know how many of you are familiar with Sonic the Hedgehog, but several years ago they released a medieval themed game where Sonic ends up in the world of King Arthur and the knights of the round table.

I’m not going to explain the entire plot with incredible detail, but there are some neat similarities between it and Mistborn era 1. (I haven’t read Era 2 yet, so pls no spoilers). 

Basically though, the entire kingdom is under the oppressive rule of King Arthur, who has been twisted into an evil, almost demonic figure, by the power of Excalibur’s scabbard. Sonic is summoned by Merlin’s granddaughter, Merlina, to defeat him and save the kingdom. But after Arthur is defeated, she revealed that she is actually a villain, and takes up the scabbard for herself, and using its power alongside her own magic becomes a powerful god-like being that plans to trap the world in an endless state of stagnant existence. No more death, but no more living either. Eventually Sonic is blessed with the sword Excalibur, becoming god-like himself, and uses it to defeat her.

King Arthur is kind of like the Lord-Ruler. The tyrannical overlord that apparently was simply keeping a greater evil at bay.

Merlina has a similar role to Ruin, though her plan is more like Preservations.

Excalibur/Excalibur’s scabbard are like shards.

And obviously Sonic is like Vin.

In Warbreaker we find out that Vasher is extremely powerful and one of the smartest investiture scholars in the cosmere. We also find out he’s invented multiple awakening technologies that served as breakthroughs in military capability on Nalthis by creating soldiers that function on magic. Specifically statues can be awoken into extremely powerful and efficient soldiers even though they’re made of rock via a connection to real humans. Anyways, Alethkar (the nation Vasher belongs to while on Roshar) turns a bunch of their aristocracy into life sized statues using soulcasters.

Is it possible Vasher could find these statues that were once people as easy to awaken as his army back on Nalthis?

This actually seems especially fitting since Sel's magic is so dependent on geographical location. Hence making the book's focus be more on the character's circumstance in where they live and such dovetails with the magical significance of location on Sel. 

I'm just wondering if this means we'd get something similar in Elantris sequels where characters like Kaise (who Brandon mentioned could be one of the main characters in a sequel) will be more static. Or did Brandon already get his fix of writing characters that are close to being perfect and need to be in order to overcome their circumstances.

Does Hoid need…,106,14fwrzk,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14fwrzk/does_hoid_need/,81,"I have a conjecture that I came up with while thinking about two actions of Hoid, that seem to be out of character. One is the fistfight with Kelsier, the other — betraying Shay. Hoid normally would rather take a punch to get what he wants than attack other person. He also wouldn’t rather put people in mortal danger. He also didn’t really have a need to do this. He could bribe Kelsier with some Cosmere information and he probably had something he could trade for the Sceptre.

There is one thing that connects these two actions. Both characters that Hoid wronged became Ghostbloods. So my conjecture is that Hoid deliberately makes Ghostbloods his enemy. Either he has a plan, or he just knows from the Fortune, that this organization should distrust him and oppose him. Anyway, I would expect in some book in the future that Ghostbloods’ dislike for Hoid becomes key for some of his goals. What do you think?",1687419466.0

I checked a few other posts, but seemingly no one has pointed out that on the system map, the cognitive anomaly is occupying a Lagrange point trailing behind Nalthis in a stable, stationary position. 

I began to wonder if it's not so much an unknown anomaly (some people speculated it was caused by the creation of Nightblood, but if this is a Lagrange point that moves with the planet, it would not have occupied this position) as perhaps a satellite of some sort (natural or otherwise) set intentionally by a shard or some other faction utilizing investiture to keep it in this orbit centered on Nalthis.

I think the most intriguing potential idea I had about this is that it's perhaps a location that did exist in the physical realm that was essentially ripped out and placed into the Cognitive Realm, causing the anomaly in real-space.  Something like a planet (given the size), and given what we've seen Shards are capable of when it comes to orbits.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on it - considering it lines up perfectly with an L5 Lagrange point for solar orbit.

Theory: True Spren are elevated subspren.

Caveat: Perhaps their current menthod of creation doesn’t involve subspren, but I think their original formation did.

Backstory: When Honor and Cultivation settled on Roshar, a system abundant with Cultivation’s investiture with nature spren, I believe Honor (and to some degree Cultivation by creating more spren) Invested in certain Spren to create True Spren which align with the Surges he’d later bind, restrict, and then structure the primary magic system around.

The most clear pointer to this speculation is how Honorspren seem very similar to windspren.

I think we see something similar to this with even the Stormfather who was a spren of storms only to be uplifted in sapience by Honor.

I think the subspren associated with the Radiant plate may be the same spren the True Spren originate from—just with added investiture by Honor, raising them to an ideal state.

An Experiment: The Relevancy of Carbon in Steel for Allomancy,42,14fstxm,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14fstxm/an_experiment_the_relevancy_of_carbon_in_steel/,16,"Possible very minor spoilers for mistborn. This is more about the mechanism of the magic system and metallurgy than anything in the plot. Anything past the first book of the Wax and Wayne ... arc? and you are fine. Also apologies to any metallurgists, I am gonna get things wrong, feel free to correct me.

# Introduction

I want to test whether carbon in steel alloys is relevant for mistborn/coin shots. This is a hypothetical experiment and is a super shallow dive into chemistry and metallurgy both in our world and hypothetically in the cosmere.

# Theory

Steel is complicated. Like way way way more complicated than iron + carbon = steel. We are gonna kinda gloss over all of the different versions of steel and pretend the version of steel used in mistborn is>!a mixture of chromium, iron, and carbon. I am picking this one because we do know pure chromium is a metal for allomancy as well as pure iron.!<The other reason I am picking it is because the idea of carbon in there is fascinating, and carbon is a pretty common and vital ingredient for a lot of steels.

The other metal in the steel isn't actually relevant for what I would want to test. What I am interested in is the carbon. First and foremost is that carbon cannot actually alloy with metals. It doesn't actually bind with the iron. The carbon causes non-conformities in the crystal structure of the iron. It doesn't actually bond with it metallically, it is just sorta in there, like pieces of fruit in gross jello.  The question here is does it get burned with the metal. So the experiment:

What we need to do is obviously make steel, but we want to make the most special steel. We need to make a steel with pure carbon 14. For those of you that don't know this is a radioactive isotope of carbon that has 2 extra neutrons. We use it for radioisotope dating, carbon dating to be specific. One of the handy things about it is it is very measurable. So much so that if you eat an abnormal amount of  C14 (either an abnormally large or lacking amount), so long as you let me measure your outputs, I would be able to tell.

# Experiment

So, what we do for this experiment is make the steel with known amount of pure carbon 14, and then have a mistborn/coin shot burn it. Then we measure their breath, and their feces, and urine, and monitor for a spike in. I expect to be able to account for all of the carbon 14. From what I can tell when you burn an allomantic metal it is entirely converted and used from burning it. If it wasn't every mistborn and thug would suffer lead poisoning (which may explain some of the effects of incorrect alloys). However, carbon isn't a metal nor is it even part of the metal, it is merely suspended in a matrix of metal (is carbon steel technically an advanced composite?).

**Control Groups:**

Each control group will be made of 3 groups: A group of non-mistings, a group of non-steel mistings, and a group of coin shots. All groups will have all breath, feces, and urine collected before testing as well as during the tests (24 to 48 hours ish?) to measure changes in carbon 14. Any unexpected changes in test subjects would be notable.

C1 *Baseline:*

Have this group live lives as normal. Might also be a good idea to divide coinshots and have half burn regular steel and have other not allowed to use allomancy.

C2 *C-14  No Burning:*

This group will eat an amount of pure carbon 14 equal to that used in the special alloy I talked about above.

C3 *C-14 Steel, No Burning:*

This group will eat the special carbon 14 steel alloy, but will be instructed not to burn it if they have the ability.

\*\*Test Groups:\*\*To keep things from getting complicated later we will assume people who cannot burn steel have matching results to the above test groups. I would make non allomancers and non-steel mistings attempt these, and they should match C1 & C2. So for simplicity this is a group of coinshots. These groups should be heavily monitored for negative impacts associated with burning poor quality alloys.

*T1 C-14 Burning:*

Have the group eat the pure carbon 14 and attempt to burn it. They *shouldn't* be able to, but it would be best to know.

*T2 C-14 Steel:*

Finally! We have the coinshots burn ALL of our special C-14 Steel.

*T3 Carbon Free Steel:*

This group would attempt to burn the steel with the levels of>!iron and chromium!< used in the C-14 steel, but with no carbon of  any kind.

# Hypothesis

Groups C1 and C3 and T3 will have matching levels of C-14 detected. groups C2, T1, and T2 should have matching levels of C-14 detected. No groups should experience any changes or should be able to tell the difference in any of the steel.

# Thinking About Results

If the results I propose come back like I expect, congrats, I am big brain haver, and carbon steel is pointless. Stop making it with carbon. What is *really* interesting is if the results come back *different*. If when the c-14 steel is burned and we find less carbon that means it could be being burned. and this opens up a world of possibilities.

But the one that I am *reaaaallly*  interested in is if the carbon in the steel actually matters and T3 gets messed up by the LACK of carbon. Why might that matter?! Well because obviously carbon can be burned but THE OTHER EXPLINATION IS WAY, WAY MORE AWESOME!!!!!

It would mean the crystal structure of the metal itself might matter! What this means is we would have a whole new world of allomancy to play with. Different aging methods, different conditions, different heat treatment methods, it isn't just the atoms that matter it is the organization of them. WHY WOULD THAT MATTER?!?!?! WHO KNOWS BUT KNOWING IT MATTERS, MATTERS!!

But, you know, it's just like a story, so sad.

Brandon have said that he wants to complete Era 3 and Elantris 2 and 3 before writing Stormlight 6-10. 

Assuming that I think Stormlight 5 needs to come to a conclusion that has already been foreshadowed, and he have also said that he have setup Stormlight 6-10 during the first books. 

My conclusion is that the Human/Singer war will end in Stormlight 5. And the conflict during Stormlight 6-10 will be a Roshar/Scaladriel/Sel conflict. 

One thing I realised is that the Ghostbloods doesn't do much at all during the first 4 books that have any real impact on the story so far, but there is a huge focus on them. So they will probably be the spark that sets of the Cosmere wide conflict. 

Both R-Odium and T-Odium have Cosmere ambitions, and I think that Cultivation is cultivating the strongest possible Warriors and the strongest version of Odium for the comming war.",1686467954.0

How many of you out here are very similar to Sanderson in the sense that you have an idea to create something similarly huge with similarly connected yet distinct power systems and worlds. (Either inspired or intuitively thought of). 

I know a guy who's exactly like Sanderson. Their strengths and weaknesses, love for world building and the vision for their franchise to grow to a massive scale everything is exactly the same as what Sanderson has achieved. What's actually amazing is this person I know, didnt know about Sanderson until last year and has been working on their world building for past 5 years and has only recently gotten on the internet and hasnt read any fiction books at all. In my opinion they are honest when they say that they didn't know Sanderson and yet has somehow managed to develop an idea (in essence) very similar to Sanderson'. 

So drop a Yes if you are like this person and do let me know if you've started working on this idea. I whole heartedly wish all such writers and world builders best of luck and all the success.",1686417716.0

The metal basically fuels the opening of a doorway for the Investiture to pass through, in a process that burns through the metal as a paid toll. The (empty) metal determines the methodology, or flavor, of its output, in the way that gemstones change the methodology of certain tools. 

Compounding is just the same unlocking of that doorway, but with the existing stored investiture type tainting the flavor into a different output. The way knights can use any gemstone in a “no you fuel MY usage!” way. Burning unsealed metalminds is going to be crazy if used as special forces battery packs.

International fans: how are the translations in your language?,44,1454uqf,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/1454uqf/international_fans_how_are_the_translations_in/,78,"I read the books in English and never really gave any thought to the translation issue, until I grabbed a couple Italian copies for my old man who can't speak English. I skimmed them a bit and (having a linguistics background) immediately appreciated how much the Italian translator must have considered their life choices. 

Brandon's naming schemes rely so much on compound words, and those get VERY unwieldy in romance languages. Also I don't blame the translator but I spotted a few straight-up mistranslations (ie Lievecanto for Lightsong, with the ""light"" part intended as ""lightweight""). I feel that the best choices were those that bypassed the compound word problem (Conciliatore for Warbreaker, meaning something like ""peacemaker"". Not at all literal but very true to the spirit). A couple conundrums had no solutions, like all the Cryptics being named after synonims of ""pattern"" that just don't exist in my language.

I also looked up a few samples from German and Spanish versions for comparison and German looked alright to me (my German is very limited but I guess compound words are not a problem there), while Spanish was a bit hit or miss (Nacido de la Bruma is such a mouthful but then again I can't think of a better option). 

On the bright side I noticed that Brandon's prose is fairly easy to translate given how concise it usually is. 

Anyway I'm curious as to what you think of your localised versions. Please don't be mean to the translators, they work an unforgiving job. And of course if by any chance we have a Cosmere translator here I'd love to read about their experience working on the books.",1686316178.0

I just finished up the Mistborn Era 1 trilogy for the first time and absolutely loved it. Not as much as Stormlight--though, I do think it's a bit of an unfair comparison--but I still loved it. However, there's one connection that I absolutely should've picked up on sooner.

After wrapping up Hero of Ages I was thinking about the similarities in the magic systems. It's incredible how Sanderson manages to create these magic systems that are so unique with their own identities, while having them still operate on a lot of the same principles.

But the one specific principle I've been alluding to is the connection between and Allomancer Snapping, and Surgebinders swearing Ideals. I absolutely feel silly for not getting that as SOON AS Kell first mentioned Snapping.

I'm sorry for the semi pointless post, but it really is so cool how Sanderson has built these Cosmere magic systems, and it just makes me wonder how many other similarities there are between Allomancy and Surgebinding that I haven't picked up on.",1686299540.0

>!Kaladin changing tactics only to get everyone killed.!<
>!When he finally miraculously saves everyone.
The way the storm hanging was described. Just epic how he survived it. Hard to pull off wirhout just feeling convinient.!<
>!I’m probably just listing the the ends of each Act, but I notice that although theres a lot of good character interactions in between, Brando Sando’s biggest strength is his anticipation. His books can be as long as they are because he spends a lot of time baiting, teasing, developing, and ENSURING that the payoffs really really payoff. So when those moments hit, I’ve spent chapters upon chapters that I’ll forget individually looking forward to them and then getting this memorable merge of “oh finally” and “OH thats what he meant!” Surprising yet inevitable, but memorable for how much my brain has built it up in my head and then been thrown off so positively that I really have to pay attention!<

>!Shallan honestly didnt grab me at first. Her arc was still fine, but I think her main conflict being ‘eventually steal a thing’ made it a slow burn and although they made it clear she was doing it because her family was poor, I don’t remember any chapters delving into just how bad it was. (Though apparently a lot of them blatantly did.) Book 2 was when they suddenly started revealing in droves a) how abusive it was, b) how Shallan finally resolved it, and c) that her father never actually did the initial thing he was accused of and so she blames herself for that abuse. As interesting as that was to unfold over time, for me that created a distance where until then I didnt fully invest in why she was doing it; she was trying to do something slightly dodgy for a slightly difficult externally Third Party sitauation and once she was out of the passive shadow (she was active in interacting with Jasnah, but being almost poisoned and having to steal the fabrial felt externally forced upon her) in book 2, it was like the story really started going “oh theres more to it, heres what shes Actually wrestling with” as well as “here’s what Shallan can be when she lets loose.” In a way, book 2 implies Veil is the real Shallan and I like the conflict between Shallan and Veil much more than I liked Shallan on the surface. Its not bad, more like, good to great. And yeah she was good when she was dealing with Jasnah, but she was great once she was more directly interacting with the main plot around her.!<

>!The moment where Sadeas betrays everyone, and Dalinar charges in or goes back or something that made Kaladin go “oh. I think he’s one of the good ones... alright, time to save a lighteyes I guess.” And Dalinar pays that back by rescuong everyone from Sadeas.!<

>!Its possibly also just that I didnt know what was going on and Way Of Kings hits you with a lot where as Words Of Radiance can hit the ground running with people I’m already familiar with, which is telling when I skim over Way Of Kings and cant remember a whole bunch of smaller details, or entire character chunks like the opening prologue, but its also probably that it was info overloard book 1 and book 2 i started taking notes. Either way, Words Of Radiance is my favourite by far, with Way Of Kings being just as good just more setup and confusion whereas by Words Of Radiance I was able to trust the stuff I liked in Way Of Kings to advance what I liked and update me on things I’d forgotten. (I.e. I’d forgotten that Sadeas Shardblade was the one Dalinar gave him, but the book recalls freeing the slaves and Adolin telling Dalinar to give the blade back and I went “oh yeah” so Way Of Kings I get a some great moments of surprise, but in Words Of Radiance, I get surprise development on those surprises, familiarity as I already know what theyre referring to, and I get to relive the initial book all at once, theres just more triple whammy in a sequel that is just as good. In a way I’m worried I’ve got a 1-2 punch where the third will be disappointing just because of the weird threequelitis problem. 1 is good, 2 is great, 3 is unreasonable expectations that can't be met (which the book ends in warning me against, ironically).!<

>!Over time they’ll naturally blend together and I’ll forget which was which, but some arcs:!<

>!Kaladin: Book 1, he thinks he is purposeless, but accepts that he has the power to save people and even some lighteyes are worth saving. Book 2, he thinks becoming a radiant is repulsive but eventually accepts that protecting everyone, even the people he hates, is the right thing to do and only becoming a radiant can achieve that. (Weirdly I cant see where Kaladins arc goes next, I assume something to do with someone dying and the radient powers not being enough, or Moash coming back and making things difficult, but Kalladin seems to have accepted his core potential and overcome his core wound so ... I dunno, unless Tien comes back to life or something I dunno what his next stage is.)!<

>!Shallan: Book 1, Shallan accepts... see I forget, I was a bit confused by it, she ended up in 2D world and it was very abstract and I didnt entirely understand it. I feel like I was just overwhelmed and it wasn't the books fault, I didnt know what to look for and I accidentally skim when I get close to the end. Book 2, she believes she is still the weak girl who lived in an abusive home, but starts to accept what she has done to escape it and what she is capable of when changing her image of herself (though she is yet to fully accept that image or integrate it so I figure thats where its going, she needs to either become Veil entirely, realize she was Veil all along, or realize Veil is a double edged sword and integrate the good while shedding the bad.)!<

>!Adolin ... He’s an interesting one. I really really REALLY thought Sadeas would be a big part of book 3, given its named after his blade, but Adolin very abruptly saw book 2's pages running out and put an end to it. So ... I mean, I figure this is exactly what Sando said in his lecture “In RomComs, They’re going to get together, you KNOW they’re going to get together, but they’re going in the wrong direction and oops the other person they’re with has now done something that makes it harder to root for.”!<

>!I’m massively paraphrasing but I watched it earlier today and he described the rom com thing verbatim how I see Shallan/Adolin and Kaladin playing out, where Shallan and Adolin work well enough but everything I know about Adolin and everything Sando’s telling us increasingly blatantly about how Kaladin and Shallan see each other, that at some point “Adolin = good enough” is going to break and “person I didnt consider before” is the inevitable direction secretly promised underneath. Adolin hated Sadeas to begin with, so the tradjectory of Dalinar saying he cant convince Adolin he needs to trust Sadeas, Sadeas betraying Dalinar and confirming Adolins worst impulses, Adolin being a womanizer but trying to reign it in for Shallan though Adolin himself insisting ""it never lasts"", its all there as little red flags and killing Sadeas (although justified in terms of character plot, I don’t blame him one bit, someone had to do it) is the final camel straw. SO illegal and unjustifiable that Adolin knew he had to hide it. So dark that he’ll likely start derailing and pushing Shallan away as a result. Works, meet spanner.!<

>!But interestingly it wont necessarily be the thing that breaks them, Secrecy shouldnt necessarily bother Shallan, she functions on lies. And the murder itself; Shallan killed both her parents, and Tyn, she’s actually the most likely to understand his situation. But the deception it will require, the damage it might do to Adolin internally in pulling that off, getting away with it or potentially being caught, and the complications when Kaladin finds out who did it, its more of a question of what will it take for Adolin to confess or go blaze of glory to never get caught, under what state and circumstance, and will Kaladin be towards Adolin how he was towards Moash when the king was threatened?!<

>!Theres a lot of factors to keep it unpredictable but Kaladin in Book 1 would have leapt to help Adolin kill Sadeas or Amaram, but how he defended the king, against his own friend, on pure 'golden rule morality' might indicate a refusal to let Adolin do anything of the sort – which will then drive a wedge between both of them and Shallan. Would Adolin try to kill Kaladin if he found out? Would Shallan side with Kaladin if Kaladin had to take Adolin down? What would Dalinar do? Adolins one rash choice is entirely in line with everything I assumed would go wrong with him, but the TIMING of it and the sudden impulse has really, I think, fundamentally sabotaged him in the process. It'll be a really hard thing to come back from.!<

>!Comparing him to Moash of all people, Moash at least had it planned out, honestly discussed it with Kaladin before hand, and even seemed regretful when he punched Kaladin “too hard.” Yeah it was out of revenge and he was ultimately willing to kill and betray Kaladin with his own blade – so in a way, Moash was as bad as Amaram, but Adolin was so mad at Sadeas betraying Dalinar, so mad at Sadeas for outsmarting him then dodging their duel, that he had no plan, no discussion, no consideration, just killed him in cold blood and instantly hid the evidence. Like I get Adolin wanting Sadeas dead, but he couldn’t even own it. He’s Moash without the regret (at least within that moment) and it was AFTER it was clear Kaladin was fundamentally against taking life of any kind, not before when Moash still thought it was 50/50.!<

>!Its not to say Adolin is corrupt as a person, but that in that moment he showed less restraint, more brutality, and more cowardice than Amaram, Sadeas or Moash, and that decision may begin a spiral that makes him Kaladins... no EVERYONE'S no.1 target, and arc wise to me it seems a narratively natural way to start distancing him from Shallan and Kaladin in a way that pushes them together.!<

>!Now, they narratively dont HAVE to get together although I personally feel the story started pushing that pretty blatantly while always having an air of denial about it down to Shall saying “Adolin didnt HAVE to be brilliant...or whatever Kaladin was. So there.” Like shes trying to prove something to us and defend a position Sando knew we would take, ironically protesting in a very wink wink nudge nudge way. But for me the question isnt “Will Shallan and Kaladin get together?” so much as IF thats the plan, then will they survive the journey and how will they develop from triangle to couple? Adolin killing Sadeas really seems to trigger exactly that journey, but for me its now a big question of What Becomes Of Adolin when its all said and done?!<

>!Especially if Adolin kept losing to Sadeas then to Szeth and then he watches two radiants go on without him together, he’s really at risk of being left behind and I dont know where he would draw the line Because Of His Choice To Kill Sadeas if he gets desperate enough to prevent that or catch up. Oh hell, even RENARIN is a radiant now, the weakest link, who sat doing nothing during their duel, now has more honour and power than him. Like Adolin is in the WORST narrative place anyone could be, I feel so bad for him. In DBZ terms, he’s kind of Yamcha. Loses the girl, once was a strong fighter but now gets constantly owned. Renarin is I guess Krillin in that sense (odd theres literally already a Tien in the story) but when you’re giving more power and screen time and skill to Krillin over Yamcha... yeesh.!<

>!Dalinar is an interesting one. All signs pointed to the king dying; Moash was going to assassinate him, Kaladin was officially out of options for the first time ever, everyone else was gone, and that comment from Sando about a war hero having to be king made me think Dalinar was garunteed kinglyhood just to end up going “oh no wait, im just a soldier, i dont know how to king” in the next book (maybe I misremember the context and he was referencing Game Of Thrones or something) so the king surviving, Sadeas NOT surviving, and Dalinar going “hey god, so... all the main characters got to be radiant. Even Renarin for storms sakes. I’m the leader here, I think I deserve to be one!” “Okay! But im not really god so good luck with that!"" was not at all the ending I was expecting. Pretty much all the Kaladin / Moash / Shallan / Adolin feels right on course character wise, but the implications are very hard towards Has To Get Darker Before It Gets Lighter and Adolins one decision is like a house of cards for the rest of them. That blatant flip where they all actually won and then Sadeas just abruptly doesnt get to make any sort of comeback completely threw me. If not for how Oh God Adolin No! It felt, techincally everyone succeeded and nothing went wrong in that final battle. It was a complete victory if not for the slippery slope feeling about it. I was not at all predicting a complete victory, I figured the god would continue to be a threat and Sadeas would come back in a big way to sabotage them and the king would be the cost expense of surviving the rest of it. Like it would be bitter sweet if anything. And its far better for it; this way its like “theyre all radiants now... but at what cost?” For Adolin, he’s left out and now in hiding. For Dalinar, I figure him not being allowed a blade and the god not being a useful god thing is gonna... even the start of Way Of Kings mentions how its strange the parshendi are all acting the way they do. We dont fully understand the real threat, Dalinar still doesnt understand the vision and so I feel like the next dread is ... what did he really sign up to? Whats the cost of having such a storm deity who “wont come when callled” as a spren, especially when Dalinar humiliated Amaram, but he didnt suffer much consequence, and now Dalinar wont be able to defend himself.!<

>!Amaram ... dunno what he’s up to, but he was keen to find Urithiru and Dalinar stopped him so ... all I know is where I thought Sadeas was a key threat, I now think Amaram is.!<

>!Elhokar... He went from Kaladin wanting him dead to Kaladin defending him in front of Moash. While Drunk. Its weird cause I know they're fictional but also narratively... Elhokar better clean up his act and start being a good king or I may start feeling like Moash was in the right and Moash/Kaladin broke up for nothing. I know morally its more that Moash purely wanted revenge and Kaladin is saving life for life’s sake, so they're fundamentally at conflict no matter what Elhokar is doing, but if Elhokar turns around and imprisons kaladin again or starts being petty and making things difficult, it’ll be hard to respect him as a character: it'll rob his apology, his self-aware weakness, of any sincerity and render him useless and annoying, and useless annoying characters who actively ignore their own useless and annoying traits often create unfun contrived conflict “oh no, Elhokar was an idiot again, whatever shall we do?” ""How about not write him that way"". So yeah I hope something is paid off with Elhokar at least wanting to TRY being a more useful king.!<

>!Lopen developing radiant powers. Looking forward to that.!<

>!Rock, just keep being you buddy.!<

>!It's another example of how with Way Of Kings I was still taking everything in, so I didnt really keep track of the bridge crew beyond Moash cause I knew the name. But with Words Of Radiance, I was more familiar and so learned who the bridgecrew were a bit more this time around.!<

>!Rlain knows far more than he’s letting on. He knew what the song meant, he knows about the rhythms, he noticed a difference in whatshername. I feel like the Parshendi was being foreshadowed as completely innocent and something is controlling them and Rlain has gone from “i wont betray my people” to “well theyre already doomed then, please stop them even if it means murdering them” but really needs to share what he knows so that the Radiants dont just wipe them out assuming they’re all evil – which seems to be what Shallan currently thinks they should do.!<

>!God I cant stop thinking about Adolin stabbing Sadeas in the eye, that has really stuck with me.

Is a good or bad that Brandon’s book all seem to be 20-40% better the second time reading through? Should a writer write to convey all their ideas fully through the first read?,6,145apki,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/145apki/is_a_good_or_bad_that_brandons_book_all_seem_to/,24,"To me the whole Cosmere feels built like Brandon knew we’d have to re-read so some ideas aren’t laid out to be super obvious. I think this leads some readers to have a confused and negative experience. 

I can’t decide if it’s intentional or if it’s even a bad way to write. I like it but I wanna see if anyone else thought something similar.

Conjecture Concerning Compounding,4,14597hs,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/14597hs/conjecture_concerning_compounding/,9,"I've been thinking about Allomancy and it's potential impact in the wider cosmere a lot and had a thought regarding compounding. Can Allomancy only compound using Feruchemy, or would it work when used with any other magic system?

For example, let's say an Allomancer of any kind is given a single Biochromatic Breath. They learn the proper command and store that Breath in a bit of metal they are capable of burning, the type of allomancer they are is kind of irrelevant in this case, unless they're an Aluminum gnat I suppose. When burning a metalmind, rather than getting the allomantic effect of the metal, it just releases the feruchemical charge of the metal roughly tenfold. At least this is my understanding of compounding please correct me if I'm wrong.

So an Allomancer stores a breath in a small metal bead, and burns it. Would this compound the Breath? They're still storing some kind of extra investiture in the metal that they're burning like with Feruchemy, so would it produce the same effect? I suspect an Allomancer doing this would create a single more powerful breath, sort of like what Returned have. This would mean they could reach higher heightenings by compounding, but would still only have the same number of breaths to work with that they started with.

Same thing for Stormlight. An allomancer who happens to be a knight radiant, a squire, or have an honorblade infuses and then swallows a piece of metal and burns it. Would this compound the stormlight that they stored in the metal? This would probably be far less useful due to the way stormlight leaks but could be extremely powerful in conjunction with something like Nicrosil Feruchemy. A knight radiant Allomancer might do something like infusing a bunch of pieces of metal individually and swallowing them, keeping them as emergency super reserves of Stormlight or something.

What's interesting is that if compounding works like I think, than any kind of Allomancer (except Aluminum) would be capable of using Allomancy to compound other kinds of investiture, regardless or what kind of misting they are.  


Edit: I should add that I imagine this exact reason is why Harmony is so reluctant about finding ways to create more allomancers in The Lost Metal. As we get closer and closer to more world and more magic system crossover, if compounding works like I've suggested, that any Allomancer that gets their hands on some other kind of investiture would be phenomenally dangerous.",1686326688.0

Lifeless and off-world tech,11,144g2ov,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/144g2ov/lifeless_and_offworld_tech/,3,"Two related ideas I had about combining Nalthian and Scadrian tech.

1 - If you gave a Lifeless a hemalurgical spike and you gave the right command, could the Lifeless use Allomancy or Feruchemie?

2 - Could a Lifeless use a medallion e.g. a weight medallion? I mention that one because it could be easily tested unlike warmth or Connection. More generally, could a Lifeless use an unkeyed metalmind if you gave it the right command?

If the answer to both of those is yes then you could have an army of Lifeless slaves dedicated to filling metalminds 24/7 (or equivalent on the planet of interest lol). This would be especially helpful for filling inconvenient metal minds like storing health or eyesight or age. You could basically have a metalmind-filling farm with slaves that don't need food, water, rest, or pay and since they just sit there filling metalminds all day they wouldn't get damaged or even need ichor alcohol replacements. You just switch the metalminds out on each one periodically and then you could use or sell them.

Also on a semi-related note, if an Awakener made a Lifeless from the body of a metal-born, could the Lifeless use Allomancy/Feruchemie if you put the appropriate metal in their alcohol or on their body?",1686246774.0

A planet with seas made of spores that ironically, as oceans are usually water, react violently to water is an idea only Brandon Sanderson could come up with.  I also had a great time watching YouTube videos of fluidization to understand the principal of why the spores behaved like liquid.  The characters, including Tress, were likable and engaging. I particularly liked the cannoneer with the visual impairment.  

I also loved the idea of a story narrated by Hoid in which Hoid is a character who has been transformed into an idiot.  His frustration with, and narration of, his own behavior was the source of endless humor.

The world traveling doctor from Scadriel was also highly enjoyable, especially after reading the Wax and Wayne series.

I'm completely hooked by most of the plot: Kaladin hiding in the tower, Navani working with the Sibling, and Adolin and Shallan in Shadesmar. Because of these plot points, I can't put this book down. However, I'd already been having trouble getting into Venli's side of the story, and then the flashbacks with Venli and Eshonai started. It just seems like there's no new information in these chapters, and the only reason they're there is to retroactively try to build an emotional connection between the reader and Venli. I've found myself skimming these chapters and rolling my eyes when the story goes from Venli, to flashback, then back to Venli, wishing I could go back to characters who I'm more compelled by.

I joke about how similar it is to other stuff I like, but its just evidence why I like it. The funny thing is that I’ve been writing my own series since 2008 (earliest records I can find. I was in year 8 and dreamed of writing a novel series) and every time Sanderson says “I was writing this for 10 years” I’d think hey me too. And he’d say “I’m sick of just the four elements” And I’d think “me too.” “I study storytelling, not just as a writer but as a scholar” “Hey me too.” And like, yeah nothings original. My story was initially modelled after 90s shows I liked at the time (Pokemon, Digimon, DBZ, Power Rangers, Captain Planet etc.) and I doubt Sanderson is Directly inspired by those. But it stuck with me beyond its initial inspiration; a series that grew up with me and I hope gives it a universal timeless quality. I HOPE. Then I got the critique “Too many characters” and thought ‘yeah, what if I made each story just one of the character povs” then Avengers came out and did exactly that. And all the while everytime I read books I kept getting disappointed because I just wanted to read the thing I wanted to write, (wasnt disappointed by the stories themselves, just conceptually, they were either magic no elements or magical elements but the regular cliche 4) and Avengers had similar tropes just by being a superhero story. And I got so sick of the elements that I avoided Avatar The Last Airbender when it first came out, now its one of my favourite things. Now this has similar tropes just by virtue of being a superhero story. >!Goku is similar to Superman, Kaladin is like Superman + Jesus!<, but I didn’t go into this at all thinking or knowing it would be remotely connected to the elements and nature god power stuff. I just read Mistborn, strongly connected to his storytelling lectures, and thought I’ll give Stormlight a try. Why should I fear a long series when I’m trying to write one myself? 

This is the closest anything has come to what I was writing. Sanderson favours epic war fantasy whereas mine is more Elemental fantasy, but >!the superhero elements that just happen to be based in Light, Wind, etc. makes it far more elemental fantasy than I was expecting. But we've even chosen similar superpowers. When Way Of Kings opened with Lashing I was like “oh wow, someone finally did the walking on walls thing” (In a book. Again nothings original but I hadnt seen it. Its eery that the way he Described it was exactly how I planned to, although I get vertigo so I've got a more personal perspective in mind) and then they were like So Theres Windspren and Lightweaving and I was like ... hang on.!< Is this about EVERYTHING I like?

(I dunno if the following counts as spoilers, its more like a review of trends than any specific spoiler)
Like ... its kind of inevitable that if you write what you want to read, you’ll end up reading things that are like what you write. But it was surprisingly hard to come across beyond basic stuff like captain planet / avatar 4 elements become 1 stuff.  But I can literally, in this, see the origins of the 90’s stuff, >!even spren reminding me of the elemental djinns from Golden Sun!< evolve into Avatar, evolve into Avengers, and for the same reason Stormlight has become one of my favourite things, like a direct chain of taste that kind of gives me hope that I could be next. Its not directly an elemental series, and Initially I just expected good storytelling; I never expected a specifically great story with literally all my favourite tropes in it. I didn't expect to panic several times when he did something and I went ""oh I was going to do that!"" before remembering B.S. himself said in lectures ""oh its just a bunch of magnetos. oh no, am I a hack? dont worry if you think this, what makes it unique is you."" And of course, seeing this stuff do well (if Wheel of Time can be 15 books, i dont need to fear length. If B.S. can do >!multiple planets!< I dont need to fear complex worldbuilding. If Avengers can do multiple perspectives, I dont need to fear too many characters. I still intend to make sure they're all needed, but conceptually its been a hard sell without multiple fantasy books that do so well that it shows it can be done) makes me think ‘oh god, if my story ends up even half as successful as this...’ Hearing how Brando Sando sat on way of kings for so long, how it was so hard to write, gives me hope its not just ‘too complicated’ but just adhd and like Brando Sando ""I wasn't able to publish till I learned how to edit."". Brando Sando has balanced his characters really well, but has also mastered promises and payoffs, and he's promised me everything I was looking for in a story.

But yeah ...
90’s Pokemon/Digimon/DBZ/Power Rangers. 2000’s Avatar. 
2010’s Avengers. 
2020’s Stormlight. 
I know its not exact date when they released but more the general decade I discovered each one in. I know I shouldnt be surprised as fantasy-action fans are often inspired by the same stuff, but wow right on cue. I'm rambling because my stuff is still a work in progress and I'm trying to explain why I feel a deep connection to Sandersons stuff without giving away anything about my own stories before they're fully baked, but ... This book, just... no wonder its the next big thing in the genre I like. Really really hoping that puts me on the right track, and that my thing is similar in all the right ways yet different in all the right ways as well. Like Sando I'd write it either way, but to be the next big thing for all the reasons the stuff I love was the previous big thing, thats the dream.",1686050345.0

For context, I’ve read the Mistborn trilogy, Elantris, and Warbreaker.

Part 1 started off very strong, albeit very heavy with all the magical terms, locations, namedropping, history, and religion. That opening chapter with Szeth (how is this pronounced by the way?) was all kinds of awesome. The Lashing magic was super cool even though I found myself constantly rereading sections to make sure I was following which wall/direction Szeth was Lashing to. Eager for more of that. Didn’t see anything else from this character, but that one chapter alone has me excited for more.

Kaladin Stormblessed baby! I’ve seen this name thrown around a few times on this sub, so it was nice to finally dig into this character a little bit. I don’t feel like I have a lot to go off of yet, besides him being a seemingly noble character with a strong drive to help people. I really appreciated his flashback chapter with his “father” (I’m not convinced yet), and their discussion on those who kill and those who protect, as well as Kaladin’s 3rd type of person who kills *to* protect. Kaladin stepping back from the chasm ledge and choosing to try again was a great moment, now I’m looking forward to see which type of person he becomes. Also, Syl is great.

Shallan had some great moments in this part as well. I really love her interest in the arts, and her scholarly side. She reminds me of my girlfriend in this sense. Learning that her whole plan is to *steal* Jasnah’s soul caster was surprising as I didn’t immediately take Shallan to be the type to steal, but after learning more about her motivations it makes much more sense. I’m looking forward to more of her as well.

I really love the parallel between Shallan and Kaladin, both ready to give up, but both willing to give it *one more try*. I assume it’s going to work out for them… at least for now…

A few questions that I hope someone can answer (avoiding spoilers for the rest of the book/series of course)…

1. What is an ardent? What makes someone an ardent?

2. Shallan’s Memory… I’m sure this gets explained in more detail later, but so far my understanding is that it’s basically really good photographic memory? When she says she takes a part of the subject’s soul, is that literal or metaphorical? If this is a spoiler area, no need to go into details.

3. What is the difference between lighteyes and darkeyes? Is it literally just a distinction between the colour of people’s eyes that make them a certain “class” so to speak? Or do they have deeper differences/powers?

I also just wanted to say thank you to everyone in this fandom. I recently made a post about myself possibly spoiling something about Shallan. So many people were kind enough to reassure me and encourage me to keep going. A moderator even reached out to me to write a kind message doing the same. It felt very refreshing to have these encounters on Reddit. The books have been great, and I’m really excited to keep going, but already this community has shown me a lot of encouragement and support. I never liked reading. I don’t think I finished a full book throughout my entire time high school over 10 years ago. Sanderson, and this community has be so excited to read now, and I love it.

Even if nobody cares about these thoughts, I’ll keep posting them, to at least keep track of my Cosmere journey. But thank you to everyone who reads.

[TLM] On Twinborn and Savants,29,141adn2,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/141adn2/tlm_on_twinborn_and_savants/,32,"So I finally finished ""The Lost Metal"", which means I have now caught up to the entirety of phase 2 of the cosmere (though I‘m still missing white sand where I‘m waiting on the omnibus) and it was a joy to see the worlds colliding more and more, making me point at the page and yell out ""I know that thing!"" But I cannot help but wish that certain concepts I loved and consider to have vast potential had been investigated in the Wax and Wayne series more in depth.

Specifically, as can be gleaned from the title, I‘m talking about Twinborn and Savants. Miles Hundredlives, while being the villain to my least favourite cosmere book if I had to pick one, had strong implications right from the getgo of the Wax and Wayne series, using his nature as both a Bloodmaker and an Augur to get out more health from burning gold than he invested, and that was fascinating to me. But as far as I know, we didn’t get to see any character with similar abilities in the later books. Not only that, but we didn’t get to see ANY other twinborn except for Wax and Wayne, if I remember correctly. Yes, we did get hemalurgists, which fill a similar role, but due to their nature, I feel like their combat styles weren’t so much a fluent merging of one allomantic and one feruchemical art through years of experience but rather an assortment of different powers meant to give them any edge in combat they could get, and it didn’t feel nearly as natural to me as the twinborns we know. For instance, think of a pewterarm (pewter) steelruner (steel) twinborn for the ultimate brawler, a leecher spinner (both chromium) twinborn for an incredibly lucky character with the ability to leech your metals if you get close or even a seeker (bronze) windwhisperer (tin) twinborn for the ultimate sniper. So many options, yet so little variety.

Savants then. Spooks Daredevil arc was fascinating and badass and it raised my expectations for potential savants skyhigh. But then the only other savant we ever saw (and I‘m not entirely sure if he actually was one or if I misread) was the pewterarm under Miles in AoL. And I know that the drawbacks to being a savant are severe, but that’s what makes it do interesting! Think of slider (bendalloy) savants who are forever locked in sped up time but might be able to move their bubble with them, nicroburst (nicrosil) savants who passively make any misting expend their entire stock of metal in one unexpected burst via a single touch and might even be able to do so at a short distance or seeker (bronze) savants who, like Vin, can pierce copper clouds, though at the expense of never being able to turn it off.

Anyway, the Mistborn series has yet to enter at least one to two more eras, so we might see some more exploration of these concepts, but I feel like the more Scadrial progresses technologically, the less likely we are for that to happen, so I really wish W&W would have taken the chance.",1685961809.0

Painter needs to have at least one great moment of artistic inspiration during the story, likely two IMO. At some point he will likely paint for pleasure on Yumi’s world.

That will probably be a scene from Yumi’s planet that is a fantastic and otherworldly picture for most others

As per the title, I finished reading Elantris yesterday and oh Domi was it an adventure. It was kinda hard for me to commit to reading at the start  but that happens with every book so nothing bad with that. But once I got hooked it really came off as a great experience.

I wanna say a few things and ask some questions, but also wanna avoid Cosmere spoilers as much as I can, so please consider the following context before anything else and feel free to RAFO me:

I have read the first Mistborn trilogy, the Eleventh Metal, Elantris, and The Hope of Elantris. Gonna start The Emperor's Soul at some point this week so please don't spoil me anything that happens or gets revealed outside this books.

First of all I absolutely adored AonDor, it is such a great concept and in my opinion it was executed really well considering how complex it feels for me. I really visualized the Aons, the modifiers and every action regarding them and it felt so cool. But there is something I don't understand about how Raoden fixed AonDor. As far as I understood, all he did was draw the chasm line in the giant Aon Rao that was Elantris with the 4 cities (I think the place was called Kae?), but I thought the line had to be added inside the main square of Aon Aon (which isn't technically a square but you get the idea), and the square itself is Elantris, but I pictured Raoden drawing the line outside the city, when he should have drawn it inside, so did I misunderstand something?

Also is it just a big af Aon Rao enough to ""funnel"" the Dor into the ""physical plane""? (I don't really know what to call it but it seems to me as if there were different dimensions, given how Raoden still existed while Hoed, but was in a different state of existance, and given hoy the Aons feel more like channels between this plane and wherever the Dor exists)
What I mean by this is, Is Elantris itself anything special? Or does AonDor work better the closer one is to Elantris simply because of how big the Aon Rao there is? And would it be possible to create an even bigger Aon Rao somewhere else in the world and have AonDor be even more powerful there?

I didn't quite get who Ghostbloods are. If I understood it correctly, they are a group of Worldhoppers that came to Scadrial to help fight Autonomy. Did I understand it properly? And since their members are from different planets, I guess they operate there, but with different goals.

And this Dlavil guy bothers me. Sanderson describes him as he described one nation in the South. His mask has become a part of his face. If I understood it well, he and his sister were accepted to Ghostbloods, but his sister is on a mission on Roshar, while he stayed on Scadrial. At first, I thought that all people in the South came from Roshar seeing that their traditions are quite different from the North, as well as their technology, but now the former seems more likely.

I read most of the Cosmere (I'm currently reading Tress and I am wating for the White Sand Omnibus to come out, but I read everything else), and recently my girlfriend started reading the cosmere with The Way of Kings. She knows that there are different series that exist in the same universe, but nothing more.

That got me thinking, when does a new reader become Cosmere aware? When do they start to understand the hints sprinkled throughout the books?

I don't remember when it happend to me, as I was reading the books along with seeing discussions online that explained some of the history of the Cosmere. As far as I can remember, the only point where you get some clear answers is in Mistborn: Secret History, when Kelsier talks to the Worldhoppers in the Cognitive Realm.

As far as i can tell, the reader mostly gets the extra information form outside the books themselves (online or from convetions). In the first few books of each series, the hints are vague and confusing, but by the later books the hints become more frequent and the reader should understand them more.

So I think that instead of having my girlfriend read all of the Cosmere, getting mostly confused by the hints most of the time, I should explain some of the history to her (Mistborn: Secret History will probably be one of the last books she will read).

So, keeping in mind that she is going to keep reading Stormlight for now and not a different series, when should I tell her those stuff? After book 2 or 3 maybe?

I'm mostly talking about Adonalsium, the shattering, shards and vessels, hoid and the like.

Who is it folks? Currently a Dawnshard would eliminate Hoid, also stacked with investiture so he could use it if he had it. Who the fuck have we met that’s just casually hiding a Dawnshard? I’d imagine it must be someone with no current investiture powers as the Sleepless may have issues with that. Or maybe they know and are aware, but as the person can use the power they don’t fuck with them at all. 

How are the Ghostblood/Sleepless relations? Both were spying on Gavilar on the night of his death and likely longer. Could the leader of the Ghostbloods be the one putting his finger on the scale with the knowledge of a shard?

I finished Warbreaker today! Here are a few thoughts…,167,13yef8m,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13yef8m/i_finished_warbreaker_today_here_are_a_few/,35,"For context, this is my 5th Cosmere read, so far having read the Mistborn trilogy and Elantris.

Okay, holy shit, Warbreaker blew me out of the water. From the very first chapter, this book had it’s claws in me, DEEP. I absolutely loved the colour play, the mechanics behind the magic, and the world building in this book. I was expecting a very cheesy love story, but was pleasantly surprised by the journeys and outcomes of all the characters.

Siri was probably my least favourite viewpoint in this book. The mystery behind the God King, Returned, and the priests, was very captivating and kept me glued to the book. One thing I really appreciated (applying to Vivenna as well) was the way Siri and her sister both adapted to their situations, not just physically swapping places with each other, but also in their duties and development as characters. I would have guessed Siri to end up where Vivenna was, and vice versa.

Vivenna was definitely a favourite perspective. I was ALL IN on shipping her and Denth together. They had me fooled, UTTERLY FOOLED into believing the mercenaries were good people trying to help. The Denth and Tonk Fah betrayal was one of the best plot twists I’ve ever read. And maybe to some of you that’s not saying a lot, but it completely caught me off guard. Looking back at all the hints and signs made this reveal even better. Kudos to Sanderson for that one. Vivenna went through some shit, and it was refreshing to see a character who thought she had it all figured out get beat down to absolute rock bottom, only to come into herself and regain that sense of purpose and drive. I absolutely loved these chapters.

Lightsong! My poor boy! What a phenomenally written character, probably one of my top favourites from all the Cosmere I’ve read thus far. Not much to say about him other than I loved his quips, banter with Llarimar and Blushweaver (tragic), and *his* journey of literal self-discovery. The idea of a god who doesn’t even believe in himself is such an interesting premise to me. The way it played out was perfect, imo. I’m sad he’s gone, because he truly was a very lovable character, and I hope that he can somehow make a comeback someday.

Vasher. Oh boy. This is what got me hooked after that first chapter. I wish we had more viewpoint chapters from him, but I understand why it needed to be limited. He was obviously a very cool and flash character, despite his humble appearance. I knew he wasn’t who he said he was, but Peacegiver? *AND* Kalad?! Insane, absolutely insane. All I can say is I can’t wait for a sequel (please Brandon) to see how Vasher turns out.

Special mention to Nightblood, the most badass weapon I’ve yet to read. A sword with sentience, hungry to destroy evil, invading your thoughts. Amazing, and another one of my favourite characters. I was hoping Vivenna would have figured out a way to give her new sword sentience, but maybe that’s being saved for another book. Either way, Nightblood was such an interesting addition and a lot of fun at times.

Overall, Warbreaker surprised me. I don’t know why I had lower expectations with this one. It truly kept me hooked the entire time, and I feel like all the characters were incredibly interesting. Not just main viewpoint characters, but ones like Bluefingers, Treledees, Blushweaver, Denth, etc. I really really hope Brandon can eventually write a sequel to this. I need to know more about this world and want to see these characters and magic at least one more time.

Book bans?,5,13z5gcg,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13z5gcg/book_bans/,8,"Hi all, 

Brandon fan from the UK here.

However, I was wondering if any of Brandon’s books had been banned in his home state? There’s a fair bit of violence in them.

*Groom*, my friend, today marks the beginning of a new chapter in your life—a chapter filled with love, companionship, and shared dreams. As you embark on this journey of togetherness, may your path be blessed with the strength of Stormlight, the wisdom of the Dor, and the boundless warmth of Devotion.

May you find strength in the metals of your heart, and may your love for each other fuel your spirits like the allomantic flames.

To your bride, *bride*, whose radiant presence illuminates this room, let us raise our glasses. May her laughter be as infectious as Wayne's wit, her kindness as nurturing as Syl's guidance, and her unwavering support as steadfast as Kaladin's loyalty. Together, may you both explore the Cosmere's vast expanse, hand in hand, like Shallan and Adolin uncovering hidden truths.

In the tapestry of the cosmere, love is a powerful force that transcends realms, binding souls together across the stars. May your love for each other be as unbreakable as the Bands of Mourning, as eternal as Preservation's power, and as pure as the Lightweaving of a Cryptic.

And now, let us all raise our glasses high and toast to *groom* and *bride*, to their love story that begins today and continues to unfold throughout the ages. May their union be blessed with the harmony of Harmony himself, and may their journey be filled with joy, adventure, and the ever-present promise of a new dawn.

He says, “my excuse for letting you go,” instead of “my reason for letting you go.” And with either word, he’s still implying that for some reason he has to justify his letting Tress go. So he’s apparently operating under some kind of rules or laws despite his being a seemingly all-powerful dragon.

Shardblades should be cutting off body parts way more often,215,13xckx3,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13xckx3/shardblades_should_be_cutting_off_body_parts_way/,121,"So I get they don't cut living flesh. But it's also said that when they pass through the spine, they kill instantly. If I were to swing a shardblade through someone's midsection, I'd likely hit their arm after passing through the main torso. By that point it would be considered dead flesh as much as if I'd pulled it free of their body and came back for their arm, no? So wouldn't there be lots of one-armed corpses? Not even to mention other bodyparts it may encounter in similar fashion?

Edit: 

Yes I know it would be gruesome and Brandon likely wouldn't want that happening, just like he wouldn't want cheese to stop shardblades. However, he also made a whole series of systems to explain why shardblades don't cut live flesh to begin with so I thought this would be an entertaining discussion.

I'm quite sure it's been explicitly stated that severing the spine with a shardblade is akin to cutting through their brain, and kills the victim instantly. I'm also quite sure there's an example of a shardbearer immediately passing their blade back through a body they just killed to some extent, and it did in fact cut.

I think the most valid reason I've seen is: ""It likely takes a moment for the soul to fully leave"" or an argument to that extent about intent, with the body still being seen as one body, however I'm not sure how much intent plays into whether the flesh is alive, it feels rather binary and we haven't seen intent impact whether something dies before",1685610371.0

Cutting off Connection in gemstones,17,13xsbe9,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13xsbe9/cutting_off_connection_in_gemstones/,7,"Kalak's letter in RoW to the Ghostbloods talks about how Jezrien finally ""died"" due to him not having Connection to Honor anymore (+Oathpact issues), so he was gone.
Seeing as Fused are parallels to the Heralds (and Vasher's discussion on how Fused, as a specific entity, draw the ability to endure directly from Odium), we know that if you stuck a Fused in a gemstone, they wouldn't fade away because Odium lives/provides them with cognitive immortality (ignoring anti-v).
My question then: could you artificially create those conditions that caused Jezrien to fade away, for a Fused? Which means they'd be dead dead?
My two theories for how:
1) Put them in the gemstone, then surround the gemstone with aluminum. Maybe this would cause their Connection with Odium to be cut off, and their spirit would fade, as Kalak described.
2) Have a bondsmith use Connection manipulation (like Ishar did to the Windrunners by Connecting them to the ground) to take away their Connection to Odium, and stick it to anything else.

Would either option cause them to finally stop being reborn?",1685651091.0
Stormlight theory for that big event ! Possible spoilers,0,13yehym,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13yehym/stormlight_theory_for_that_big_event_possible/,25,"I have been thinking what could be the reason for recreance. There are many possible reasons, but it seems that the recreance happened over many years or even centuries. 

Brandon also confirmed that before recreance, breaking oath didnt result in deadeyes. 

So, my theory is- 

When the heralds betrayed roshar and left their duty, radiants decided to do something to save the world.  They somehow created a bond or magic that allowed the voidbringers to remain locked in braize.

This is the reason that voidbringers remained in braize, this surgebinding/oathbinding worked this way. 

To strentghten this magic jail, , in every few years, more radiants commited sacrifice. 

 This magic required sacrifice, which made spren deadeyes. Maya confirms that the event was consentual, spren choose to do this sacrifice. Saving roshar seems the only logical reason to do this. 

Over years, the spren stopped becriending humans and this gave odium an opening to invade, even when taln never broke.

I've finished reading Tress Of The Emerald Sea.
Another absolutely amazing Cosmere novel.
Something that I love about Brandon Sanderson is that he always exeeds and defies expectations.
I was expecting Tress to be just be a small story told in the Cosmere that didn't really connect to anything else.
Like the novel equivalent of a short story from Arcanum Unbounded.
So I was not expecting the book to be not only narrated by Hoid but also tease elememts of the future of the Cosmere such as the Kandra from Mistborn now being free agents, one of which even being on the Crow's Song.
As for the wait for Mistborn Era 3 wasn't hard enough already. lol
Another that I personally got a kick out of was Hoid wearing a Hawaiian shirt as part of his modern day attire, as I was actually wearing one when I was reading it.
As for Tress, I really like how at first she comes across like a character who would just be a background character in another novel, but goes through such a complete transformation.
My favorite new characters in the book though would be Fort, Ann and Laggart.
One thing that I did feel could have been a better better though was the reveal that Huck was Charlie all along.
I felt like that it was a bit obvious considering that Huck is just Chuck missing a letter though.
Maybe it was meant moreso as a foregone conclusion.
Nevertheless, I'm really excited for the rest of the Secret Projects.
Up next, I'm reading Frugal Wizard, which will be my first non-Cosmere Sanderson read.

Masterful build up to these few chapters where everything ends up out in the open. Kaladin needs to be spren-less enough to need the blade, and desperate enough to confess to Shallan, but also his lack of spren helps cover up their last secret, the best one, since her assumption he isnt radiant would now be correct and since it hasnt come up she has no need to confess her own spren either.!<

Ch 73. >!Poor Shallan.!<

Ch. 74. Less thoughts because its far less about raising questions than it is just concluding and confessing. (Mistborn spoilers) >!(I have my theories on what the stormfather is, and I think i know on pure rumour alone what is meant by the 17 shards (like, are they all gods like ruin and Preservation, i cant look up the names without potential spoilers), but I still dont know what that means for the stakes. The stormfather didnt send Syl but now hates Kaladin for breaking his promise? Ruin and Preservation implies the gods arent all just inherently threats or indifferent, but my guess being the stormfather is the one who shattered the plains - who else could? - but what does he WANT?!<

Chapter 75 - >!I dont trust Amaram. Now, it might be that Sanderson is pulling a fast one and he's a Snape sort of character, where Kaladin dislikes him and Shallan blames him (oh yeah, I hadnt put together that Amaram stole the blade but sidnt REALLY kill anyone to get it so Kaladin killed Shallans brother. For some reason I brushed it off as two seperate incidents.) But yeah, Kaladin knows he lied. Shallan knows he's up to something. Dalinar knows he wouldnt risk his life for Adolin. And here he is going 'work with Sadeas, what could go wrong?' Unless it turns out its a complete bait and switch, I may end up hating Amaram more than Sadeas for that very 'at least Sadeas is honest' angle.!<

Interludes:

>!""They have a surgebinder"" ""So, Szeth knew about Jasnah. Had she faked her death then, then, as he'd suspected?"" Aha! I was hoping, to be honest, it was too quick. Narratively needed to get Shallan on her quest but readerly abrupt and disappointing. Theres every chance she's still dead but I see what he did there; he probably meant Kaladin, there was no need for Taravangian to misunderstand, but Sanderson just had to slip that in so its probably the case. If he hadn't intended to reveal those two things he easily could have just said ""huh. Strange. Who?"" which he does slightly further on as soon as the misunderstanding is cleared up.!<

>!Now that I've seen the strength of putting Shallan and Kaladin in the same room, describing Szeth as ""broken"" perks my anticipation up.!<

The Assassin In White excuse won't work the instant he shows up in the battle - he was told to kill Dalinar and keep away from Kaladin and surprise surprise, Dalinar and Kaladin are extremely far away from each other. What if the assassin succeeds and then they have NO king? What if Moash fails and Kaladin is blamed? Like ideally, yeah the king should stand down and (well I've heard what Sanderson said about Dalinars story being the soldier who knows how to soldier but not how to rule... actually it could have been Adolin, I dont remember...) SOMEONE should take his place, but theres so many ways the plan could fall apart or just not be as politically clean as they think. its typical ""thing bad, remove thing good"" when politics is more complicated. If Dalinar got killed, would that mean Adolin or Renarin would be next?

Aw. and this is my stance too. I like that Sanderson isnt just doing the ""the guy shes with is awful"" trope, but its got some nuance where she fully opened up to Kaladin only to wall up when Adolin asked similar questions. She Likes Adolin, but could end up Loving Kaladin. That said, the reason her and Kaladin end up being so close is the same reason its hard to have a healthy relationship.

I just finished it and wow. It’s probably one of my favorites

I love all the small connections to other books. I love how it’s narrated by Hoid. I love Tress and the crew.

Ok here comes the questions/thoughts:

I’m not sure who said it, but it might have been Tress who said something about “even if death comes with screws in his eyes”. I listen to it on audio so it’s hard to say exactly but still. This is a clear sign of Marsh from Scadrial. After some quick google searches(and figuring it out later) Tress is placed sometime after Mistborn Era two. Does this mean that Marsh has been off world or at least tales of him or what?

In the end, it was briefly said that the Sorcerous used lightweaving to remove the fake Charlie’s body off the lizard creature. I thought that people who had the Nahel bond couldn’t leave roshar??

Did the Sorcerous use breathe to create her tin can soldiers? It wasn’t stated exactly, but I feel like it would be the easiest way to do such a thing.

Hoid says that Forts device had Nathian tech, suggesting that Nalthalas(or whatever the planet is called) has progressed so far that they have technology very similar to us. Am I right in this?

What is the Sorcerous?? She knows stuff about the cosmere(especially if what I’ve asked above is true) so is she a world hopper or something more akin to Hoid?

I think that’s all so my final thoughts are just wow I love this book",1685501124.0

The Nahel Bond Terrifies Me,32,13w2apt,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13w2apt/the_nahel_bond_terrifies_me/,6,"This might already be accepted, but the copper mind doesn't mention it on the Nahel Bond page. The mechanism of the Luhel is a symbiosis that is not wholly mutualistic but parasitic in certain ways. Tress gives up water for control of the midnight essence. 



The Nahel Bond is stated as returning ""anchoring in reality"" for access to surgebinding. What exactly are the radiants giving up though? 


Does it have anything to do with the Recreance or was that only tied to surge bind itself? Is the behaviour of the Sky breakers evidence of a loss of anchoring to reality?

So Secret History was... meaningless? Didn't fit in?,0,13x9k4n,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13x9k4n/so_secret_history_was_meaningless_didnt_fit_in/,56,"Edit: Hoid is the only meaningful hint that this was happening. That's all I can find. The more I think about it the more I am convinced this story didn't need to happen. Nothing mattered. Every twist Sanderson has shown until this point in his own works made previous details and hints click into place. It was an ""ohhhhh!"" moment. I loved them. This one doesn't make anything make more sense, doesn't shine on any details. It superimposes itself on a story while only superficially interacting with it, only resolving problems it creates within its own confines, only touching the original trilogy where no touching was necessary. It adds absolutely nothing of value to Mistborn and, in my opinion, detracts from how tightly knit the original trilogy was. I am greatly disappointed. This is the only Sanderson work I didn't adore.

Context: I have read everything except White Sands, Lost Metal and Stormlight Archives.

I was very surprised upon reading Secret History that it... didn't fit. Nothing that Kelsier did at any point mattered in my opinion. None if it explained anything in the original trilogy. Sanderson said he left hints that thus was happening... where?

Kelsier in the pool didn't change anything. 

Kelsier moving Preservation's knife didn't make sense. Preservation was hesitant in S.H. before Kelsier got involved, But in WoA it was pretty immediete.

Kelsier making people fight just... didn't seem to require S.H., I mean there were enough instance of crazy survivorists.

His time as a god did nothing. His whispers never mattered, never explained a behavior from the original trilogy.

Even his whispers to Spook don't agree between recountings.

The plan to send the message to Vinn about the spikes- Yeah he would have done that anyway. Sazed and Spook knew enough to do that anyway.

Marsh's removal of the earring? Didn't need Kelsier's help. It was already well established Marshes plan to get the opportunity.

The behavior of the mists between Preservation's death and Vinn taking it up makes more sense without Kelsier involved. It being drawn to her while already partially held by Kelsier just seems... uncharacteristically Main Character Power to me.

Sazed did NOT recreate the bodies as his first act. We follow his thought process. That isn't what happened. We see flower making in both and it doesn't sync

Sazed just let the people in the South freeze? Really screwed them over, huh? I recall it being said that people could only exist near the poles, and yet the Wax and Wayne suggests that these people adapted to non-polar, warmer places.

Sazed said TWO more metals? There were four- bismuth, cadmium, and their alloys. And honestly? It made more sense that atium was the reflection of gold, and the prrservation metal the reflection of aluminum. They matches better than touches and bubbles.

The only thing I noticed that connected and mattered was Kelsier's request to make Spook a Mistborn. Nothing else in that entire book seemed consequential. Sure, it explained more of the cosmere. But what I saw from the other books- Warbreaker's gods material forms reflecting their cognitive thoughts. Emperor's Soul and the mind of the objects, their souls. The cognitive shadows of Shadows of Silence.

The other books and writings on the solar systems of the cosmere all perfectly make sense with the story. Every twist Sanderson has written until now was, in my opinion, perfect. They all fit in snugly.

Secret History feels forced in. What am I missing?",1685598800.0

Bite-sized theory on Thaidakar,23,13vvc77,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13vvc77/bitesized_theory_on_thaidakar/,15,"I think Thaidakar a Roshar-ing of Kelsier. Let me explain.

Consider a couple of the Heralds:

- Taln, Talenel, Talenelat, Talenel'Elin
- Jezrien, Jezerezeh, Jezerezeh'Elin

The Heralds have been around for long enough that their names have undergone this wordplay. All things on Roshar are subject to symmetry and change and the names of the Heralds fall under this too.

I realised that Thaidakar might be this process but applied to Kelsier's name. There's not a one-to-one correspondence between sounds (see eg Scadrial/Scadarial that Shallan comes across) so if we have *si = thi* phonetically, then we can do the following symmetry wordplay:

- Kel-thi-ar
- Thi-ar-da-kel-ar
- Tha-i-da-kel-ar
- Thai-da-kar

Who is the evilest character in the cosmere?,102,13vl0mi,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13vl0mi/who_is_the_evilest_character_in_the_cosmere/,150,"Okay, so there are a lot of antagonists through out the Cosmere but they vary in types of evil. I have included a list and small summary (non-exhaustive) but who would be evilest?

I have separated characters from shards as I feel the shards intent in itself detracts from inherent choice to make evil choices. Like calling the terminator evil for being programmed to kill Sarah Conner.

I have tried to exclude as many spoilers as possible however there are definite spoilers for Mistborn Era 1, Mistborn Era 2, Elantris, The Stormlight Books, Warbreaker, and Tress of the Emerald Sea. That said, each has been identified as a possible spoiler so you might be able to read without reading all the above novels. Just be careful in the comments section.

**Shards**

1.Odium

* Destroyed several shards with plans for more
* Tortures his minions and pretty much everyone he talks to
* Hates Puppies
* God's Divine Hatred separated from the other shards which gave it context.

2.Autonomy

* Takes over whole planets through her avatars with plans for more.
* Planned to destroy a whole planet because they might one day be technologically superior.

3.Ruin

* Destroyed a shard

**Evil Characters**

2.Taravangian

* Kills thousands of people justifying his actions as saving people
* Arguably doesn't even understand why he does stuff just blindly follows his diagram
* Will use any means to get what he wants.
* Sure he feels guilty but that makes him worse because he has a conscience and is acutely aware of what he is doing but does it anyway. His misguided hero act makes him so much more detestable.

3.Straff Venture

* Raped Multiple slaves (usually underage) knowing he's condemning them to death
* Used said rape to create misting children, using children as weapons
* Beats children and finds joy from holding power over others.

4.Riina the Sorceress

* Unusually cruel and will curse people instead of killing them to prolong their suffering.
* Kills everyone who enters her sea and sometimes sends her monsters into other seas just for kicks
* Keeps people aware of their curses so they know how it can be cured but can't act on it.

5.Dilaf

* Psychopathic, takes pleasure in others pain.
* Forced an apprentice to give his life to teleport him a distance that would have taken him 15 minutes to walk.!
* Will happily burn an entire continent

6.Sadeas

* Known for his cruelty and brutality, perhaps best personified by the use of bridge crews
* He will sacrifice people, lie and manipulate to achieve his goals

* Killed Teft

10.Amaras

* Killed his own men

11.Iadon

* Bought back serfdom and elevated people to nobility based on wealth
* Sacrificed multiple people for voodoo magic in the hopes it would kill someone else.
* Tried to destroy an entire city of the sick, who he banished and imprisoned there in the first place

12.Captain Crow

* Condemns her crew to a life on the run instead of asking if they could sail somewhere
* Kills anyone who speaks out against her
* Tried to sell someone to slavery to cure her incurable disease.

13.Bluefingers

* Tried to sacrifice a young teenage girl
* Tried to start a war between two nations which would have ensured the deaths of thousands.
* Was trying to stop the subjugation of his country

This is my list. I have not included villains who aren't in the story much such as Bloody Tan. And I have also not included characters who were mentally unstable such as Bleeder. And I did not include the Voidbringers or the Unmade as they are unduly influenced by Odium.

Please let me know if I missed anyone or if you agree or disagree with the order!

Minor spoiler questions:

So Sazed's last message said their were FOUR other metals? I assume the two on the chart let you flair and deplete someone else's metals and the other two are somehow off the chart or another layer of it.

Then the focus shifts to Urithiru and the Shattered Planes kinda falls into the background.

Something shattered it. And the shattering is symmetric with recognisable repeating patterns, allowing for some weathering and crem buildup over time. What shattered the landscape like that? When did it shatter roughly, was it around the time of the Desolations or after the Recreance or maybe much earlier? Could it be tied to when humans first came to Roshar?",1685422071.0

Imvested arts in the cognitive realm,7,13vs7bv,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13vs7bv/imvested_arts_in_the_cognitive_realm/,3,"Tldr: Can all invested arts be used in the cognitive realm?

Allow spoilers for: All of mistborn + SH (Apart from TLM which im on chapter 29), All of SA up to and including Oathbringer, Warbreaker, any WoBs whoch dont contain big spoilers.

Context: i recently finished OB and im reading TLM for the first time whilst my friend has read mistborn and has just started TWOK. He mentioned if he was in the cosmere he wouldnt mind if he died provided he could use his surgebinding or allomancy. We know that when you die you go to the beyond and we have no clue if the invested arts can be used there. 

Ok so when kelsier died, the ties between his physical, cognitive and spiritual aspects were severed (as far as i understand), thus, he cant use allomancy as that draws from the spiritual realm. However, when Kal and Shallan are chilling in the cognitive realm throughout OB they can use surgebinging (more below if wanted) and i recall azure doing funky stuff with breaths but i hadnt read warbreaker at that point so i cant recall exactly what. We also know that hoid (probably) cant use his invested arts because that would make travelling quicker for him- this could be due to him being in the spaces between worlds where shards cant reach but we know he beats that mechanic so why not this one...

(More from above). 
Firstly, i thought that Kal and Shallan were able to use their arts in the cognitive real because their minds thought they could. As its the cognitive realm, them thinking something makes it a reality (to a very limited degree) so Kal believing and imagining he could lash lets him lash. Whereas in Mistborn, Kel cannot even imagine that he could steelpush without steel in his body and therefore cant achieve the same feat through imagination. However this theory falls apart when we see that Kaladin and Shallan are actually draining the stormlight from the spheres to fuel their surgebinding. This means its almost certainly not down to believe and imagining in the cognitive realm. Im an advocate for the fact that Kels bond to the spiritual realm is severed whilst Kals bond is not so Kal can use his arts in the cognitive realm. This still doesnt explain why worldhoppers- even those who follow the rules unlike hoid- cant use their steelpushes to navigate the cognitive realm.

Give them what they want but not the way they want it.

>!Honestly I've been getting so many forced sitcom/marvel subplots that I forgot just how invested I used to get in teenage romance (Tai and Sora in Digimon, Stevie and Phil in Saddle Club, So Little Time and whoever). Nothing about this series said to me ""the best part will be the romance"" but This. Is. Romance.!<

>!Kaladin admitting he wishes people could be more like Shallan. Ugh.!<

>!Shallan instantly hearing that ONLY as a backhanded compliment because he's been picking on her so bad for it. Uuugh.!<

>!Shallan giving a big speech about everything she's been feeling, that she wouldnt even tell Adolin about, in a way that somehow both crushes them both and yet lightens them both up. UUGH.!<

>!I visercally wanted to throw the book. Its 12:30pm and there is no one around and I verbally yelled ""KISS.""!<

>!You have no idea how invested I am getting in this. At first I was like 'you're reading into it' now im like, afraid for the characters cause its a downright promise and I dunno how much Sanderson cares about point of view plot armour.!<

>!I watch a lot of media. I analyze a lot of stories. I get used to going ""oh narratively this"" and seeing if I'm right. Its rare when you learn to notice mechanics that you just feel like two lives are organically unfolding, and she gets him telling jokes and its all fluffy and then he mentions Tien and I'm like ... don't. Not again. and thats precisely what Kaladin would say and why he wont get close and like ... I feel like I am legit in both their heads now.!<

>!Shallans speech about how much she suffers ... I relate to that in ways I wont go into. But then the way Kaladin keeps losing people ... again, I relate. I've lost all objective plot brain and I now want both of these people to get together and be happy and now I'm scared because plot has to happen. I get now why some people read books, find out someone they like dies, and just refuse to keep reading so they dont have to experience it.!<

>!And then ... as all love triangles do, a cliche but a classic, Shallan mentions nit JUST adolin, but how she'll kiss him when she gets back, and WHAT does Kaladin do??!<

""Adolin. Right."" HMM I FEEL SOMETHING. I HATE THIS LADY. NO WAIT, NOT HATE. WHATS THE OTHER THING. DUNNO. BUT IT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER THAN I EVER HAVE BEFORE. WHATS THAT? A BOYFRIEND. OH YEAH, FORGOT... WAIT WHY DO I FEEL SAD NOW?!<

>!I dunno how to put it into words to strangers on the internet. I got into the office because I was really into Jim and Pams relationship. But I rarely if ever watch/read something FOR the romance. But this has honestly worked me up in a way that I started kicking my seat, shaking the book and yelling:!<

>!Come. On. Just. Kiss.!<

>!How did two main characters who spent an entire book apart come together for only a few chapters in the 4th out of 5th acts, and get me this emotiknally invested in something that wasn't even clearly the direction its currently going in. Its blanket what Sanderson said ""tell them you're giving them a gift (adolin and shallan) but then keep telling them how much better it would be if they got an airplane instead (shallan and kaladin) and then tada, oh wow what I really wanted was what I was getting all along."" But because Sanderson knows the key to tension is uncertainty, he's dangling all these secrets and subplots under my nose so thst I have to go ""yeah but what if Shallan dies and Kaladin goes back to feeling like he loses everyone. He does that...""!<

>!And I realised why I like Shallan as a character so much now. Its not just the romance and how much her backstory makes her more relatable to Kaladin, its that her speech was so much like Robin Williams's ""Spark Of Madness"" speech and Thats what I relate to. ""You've got to be crazy. Too late to be sane. Angels have wings cause they take themselves lightly. You're only given a spark of madness. Don't ever lose that. If you lose that, you're nothing."" Laughter and wit in the face of absolute dread. And its also why I'm scared for their relationship; its why Kaladin likes her, its why they would before now reject each other, but its also why Kaladin could easily shut up, and I'm not sure (although its clear she can be more of herself around Kaladin) she NEEDS him yet the way he needs her in a way that she would push if he would ever pull, which is why she's more inclined to go ""huh, maybe I should look into this guy"" but also go ""and then get back to Adolin.""!<

Everything would say to me its the other way around, but I get why from Shallans view the darkness kaladin carries would trigger her own - and vice versa - and theyre both trying so hard to avoid themselves becoming stronger (aka like the thing that overpowers them) that they're taking it out on each other in order to insist they'll never be like that. Shallan can't accept she IS Veil, Kaladin can't except he IS stormblessed.

Its interesting how to Kaladin thats a strength and her lack of difficulty is a flaw, but also thats why he goes around hating everyone and ... whats the solution? for everyone to suffer as much as he does? To communicate misery without inflicting pain... tall order. But also he's wrong, Shallan has been through hell.!<

>!This chapter is, narratively, positive pain. If theres one thing Kaladins words gets me thinking about, its that eustress and distress. Eustress keeps you moving, Distress keeps you bogged. Kaladin only feels alive during battle because its when his distress kicks into eustress, when he has something to actively fight for. Its what tempts him to kill the king, but also what saves Adolin when he otherwise dislikes him. Its interesting that he would assume Shallan is happy go lucky - because thats what makes her feel alive when she is otherwise scrambling to get her family back on track. We have two people drowning, who present to those around them like they are for the good of their people, but one wants to kill the king and one wants political gain. And so its interesting that Kaladin would complain about Shallans LACK of drowning because Kaladin cant tell the difference between what empowers him and what destroys him, even though she is drowning and the only person she can open up to about it equally drowning to the point where he can't hear her. This chapter above all convinces me this story hinges on them finding some way to work together. If only they both weren't so guarded, they WOULD understand the other suffers as much, but more importantly at the point they understood what the other was going through they'd first need to get over their own blinders, at which point they wouldn't WANT the other to suffer because they're better off when both of them are working at full strength. The chapter therefore is extremely productive, healthy, positive, but all they would see is two people constantly arguing; someome who is suffering and someone who would never understand, and they would even argue about which is which. I know what *I* want by the end of the book, but I can't say I can remotely predict HOW i want it. The many other characters could EASILY throw a spanner in and make their whole sitiation far more difficult.!< But thats why I love this series; Brando Sando makes things seem downright impossible to achieve, and then somehow the characters achieve them.!<",1685452554.0
Bonds and realms,2,13vr8ve,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13vr8ve/bonds_and_realms/,16,"After reading Tress a thought occured to me, and I'd be much grateful for anyone's two cents about it. 
Currently we know of two types of bond in the Cosmere: a Connection between two where one gets access to some form of Investiture manipulation and the other gets ... something.
For me these seem to be somewhat connected to realms.
The Nahel bond offers acces to cogniton.
The Luhel bond offers access to physical material (usually water)
So far, here we are, but there's a third realm. So my hypothesis is this: 
There's a a bond (Bond?) where one entity gets access to Investiture manipulation as normal and the other one gets access to a piece of spirit web. I think we've also seen an example of this in the case of Shards. If I remember right vessels are cognitive shadows and according to in universe arcanists a cognitive shadow is ""only"" an Investiture over infused copy of a soul.
So I think when you take up a shard it gets to eat your soul (kinda) and you get to be (a) god.  Fun!",1685455464.0

Thanks everyone, I get it now. My brain was too busy trying to work out what the word sock was meant to be instead of connecting the predictive text assuming the lost item was, a very commonly lost, sock. My bad. 

First time reading so please don’t spoil if it can be helped. Tress and Fort are having a conversation when she tells him she’s looking for someone. Fort replies “Ah, Fort wrote. So you’re searching the seas, like Salay. Hoping that at each new port, you’ll at last find the sock that… He deleted that part. Sorry. Board isn’t always good at predicting. You’re hoping to find that PERSON you’ve lost”

I feel like a joke went over my head. Was the word sock meant to be eluding to something else? Or is it just a kid joke about predictive text?

Origin of Urithiru,14,13v5hmr,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13v5hmr/origin_of_urithiru/,8,"I have a theory that Urithiru was created using Rysn’s Dawnshard. A few days ago I posted a theory saying that Soulcasters and other fabrials made of Radiant spren were created the same way. But someone simply said they didn’t like that theory and downvoted so it never got any other responses. Soulcasters are unlike other fabrials in that they don’t trap the Radiant spren. Rather, they are the Radiant spren. And so I believe the Dawnshard, Change, was used to create these. And what other fabrial IS a spren rather than housing one to function? Urithiru. It’s pretty obvious the Sibling underwent this change. It does not manifest as a normal spren the way even the Stormfather can. Plus, the old Radiants that left the tower refer to Urithiru and the Sibling synonymously. “But the Soulcasters seem to be asleep. There’s no other fabrials with spren that are sapient.” I’ll point your attention to the Oathgates. Spren turned into fabrials. Albeit much larger ones than soulcasters",1685391857.0
Words Of Radiance (CH 69),18,13v2fvx,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13v2fvx/words_of_radiance_ch_69/,9,"After just letting the chapters flow for a bit, certain things have popped up that make me both think I'm right on track and also that everything has drastically changed. 

>!I can't believe Adolin gave Kaladin shards and he gave it to Moash. I physically gasped. But that was a previous chapter. It really speaks to how Adolin and Kaladin's relationship is gaining this Golu/Vegeta respect and its probably my favourite thing about the series now.!<

I've got to admit, when Brando Sando >!Killed Jasnah early on, I was honestly disappointed. I didn'f really take to Shallans chapters in the same way as Kaladins. It felt sort of B story to the A story. But ever since she joined up with Adolin and Kallan and her wit just came out with the flashbacks - maybe it was there before but I'm especially noticing it now - I freaking love her character. I'm a big fan of cheers and her dialogue of ""Am I going to have to listen to you prattle all the way back?"" ""I also intend to do some blathering, a little nattering, and the occasional gibber. But not too much, lest I overdo a good thing."" and them dressing each other down ""Its easier for you to pretend that every lighteyes is abusing you because of your status"" ""Everyone beneath you is a plaything. You stole my boots. (...) I'm not holding a grudge abkut the boots. From what I've seen you're not as bad as the others."" ""You""ve never liked me. (...) And not because of the boots. I see how you watch me."" ""Why is it that being around you makes me want to claw my face off?"" has 120% ""The more he cared the more he pretended he didnt care"" ""I'm the best thing that ever happened to you and you're too stupid to realize it."" Cheers s1 energy. All Kaladin needs to do is look past his his prejudice which he ALMOST did by just saying she's not so bad, and as far as I'm concerned I think he'll find the obsession is still there but the hate is completely replaced by a dynamic where he really understands her and vice versa in a way she and Adolin could never have. At least as of now, I like how I'm 100% sure theres something there and Brando Sando is being intentional with it but betrothing her to Adolin and having them both enjoy it really tricks my brain into thinking it could go either way.!<

>!Given the way Kaladin and Shallan have hidden their powers from each other and yet Adolin noticed only being close up in battle, I take this as big potential foreshadowing that Amaram (or Sadeas, or Dalinar, or anyone really) could easily be hiding a spren of their own. When Dalinar (or was it Kaladin who said) he's missing something obvious I'm at the point where I'm sure there's like 12 'obvious' things I've missed cause thats why the book works. But my money is on someone other than Kaladin and Shallan having a secret spren that will pop up at the worst possible moment!<

>!The way Kaladin says his powers are fading because his spren is an Honourspren and he has made two seprate promises and can't keep his word has got me thinking about the book titles. If Way Of Kings is about how the leaders should conduct themselves 'Strength before Weakness, Journey before Destination' and all of that, then Words Of Radiance must relate to the ""Most important words a man can say"". Which sounds obvious but they brought that up in the previous book and for some reason I thought Wit had a conversation with Kaladin that resolved that already, something about Novelty being stronger than anything else. But now I'm thinking I misremembered that and by Words of Radiance they mean Promises of the Knights Of Radiance. They made vows, and broke them, and lost their powers. So when Kaladin vows to protect his crew, and does so, he becomes more powerful. But when he makes two seperate conflicting promises and considers breaking them, his powers fade. I dunno if this is blatant context or something I'm just assuming, but thats where my mind went when I heard Kaladin say he couldnt keep his promise. By extension, it didnt hit me till now that Rhythm Of War has to relate to the Rhythm forms in the interlude, so that random segments I can hardly remember ... warform will become extremely important somehow. And Oathbringer... if its the name of Sadeas's sword, I'm betting we get to find out how he got it. Though knowing the Sanderlanche, for all I know Sadeas could suddenly be dead in several chapters. I can see what Brando Sando is planting down, but the way he guides the progression in surprising ways means I often get to chapters like Kaladin and Shallan bickering and go ""Yeah. like that. but ... wait, no the context is so different now...before I wanted to see Adolin go rogue and Shallan/Kaladin start to hook up... noe Adolin and Kaladin have fought together and Adolin rivalry-respects Kaladin for it so ... I dont want that to end just ... clearly Kaladin is hotting for Shallan and can't handle it and so thats gotta burn up or fizzle out or something so ... ugh I just want the three of them to get along now.!<

>!But yeah, Kaladin and Shallan bonding ... sort od ... the tension is perfect. I'm really not in the habit of guessing shipping pairs but Kaladin really goes hard at Shallan in a way he doesnt do for Sadeas, Amaram, Adolin, etc. This chapter was something I didn't realize I was blatantly waiting for verbatim. For them to both have spren, for them to both believe they had inadvertantly saved the other so neither suspects the other, for their mutual history with Amaram that neither talk about, for them to dislile each other so much but its so clear that their dislike is based on seeing right through each other, not on Kaladin/Adolin competitiveness or Kaladin/Amaram genuine hate, they just get wbat the other is about and theyre both in such a coniving place (to quote Cheers: You love each other. And you hate each other. And you hate yourselves for loving each other). In fact, I'm really starting to like them all as a trio; even the way Adolin respects Kaladin but still calls him bridgeboy, then Shallan starts defending Adolin. It all just works. Kaladin and Shallan understand each other but hate each other, Kaladin and Adolin dislike each other but respect each others strength, and Shallan and Adolin care for each other but I sense a distance there only because Kaladin sees what she hides from Adolin and Adolin sees what Kaladin hides from Shallan. Yet Adolin can tell Kaladin has powers, but hasn't caught on Shallan has the same source. The tension is insane because its built on organic misunderstanding, I just want to jump in and go ""look, shallan and adolin have a good arranged marriage, they seem to genuinely like each other. Great. But come on you guys, you both have family murdered by Amaram. You both have Spren. Just figure it out! You don't have to fall in love (although Kaladin, come on, you keep emphasizing how she makes you feel weird and how much you watch her 'out of suspicion' I'm sure.) but with so much mutual hate for Sadeas and Amaram, You Shallan and Adolin could totally be Golden Trio-ing it right now but you've all got to be so stubbornly guarded about it. Like this is late book 2 and you guys are STARTING to get along? Its a testament to Brando Sandos writing that he doesnt just rush it, but I feel like duing the Adolin-Kaladin fight the sprens noticed each other, and now Kaladin is considering helping Moash when at this point Moash is becoming the dark-coin temptation to the new life he could have ... gah! Its such a nuanced relationship web. I love it.!<

>!Ooh, last minute thought, now that Moash has shards, I'd love to see him challenge someone. He is insisting he's totally Bridge 4, but he already went behind Kaladins back. Kaladin gave up the shards because he wanted revenge on the king, so theres so much conflict potential there. If Moash starts acting like Sadeas or Amaram, what does Kaladin do? If Moash challenges Adolin, who does Kaladin hope wins? If Moash were to challenge Dalinar, would Kaladin hate him for it? If Moash were to challenge Amaram, would that renew loyalty? What if Moash challenged one of their enemies only to lose the shards? Or even weirder, what if Moash was the secret spren guy and started inexplicably winning shards, while only in hindsight revealing that he totally could have saved/helped Adolin or Kaladin earlier and didn't. What if Moash started challengjng Adolin and somehow won? Like I get that Kaladin trusts his crew and was willing to hear Moash out, and that getting imprisoned pushed Kaladin into a bad moment of decision making ... but if I hated lighteyes only a fundamental race-generalized basis, and anyone who gets shards becomes lighteyed, and the person you thought was close to you is secretly harbouring an assassination attempt behind your back ... I would NOT trust that person with the worlds best weapon. Maybe Kaladin was thinking 'give it to the person who hates lighteyes the most' in hopes Moash would resist the warmongering the best... but my gut reaction was ""You just gave Judas a machine gun.""!<",1685384588.0

Finished Elantris! - Thoughts,11,13u6zd2,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13u6zd2/finished_elantris_thoughts/,9,"So, I got started on my Cosmere experience with Mistborn Trilogy last year, then read Warbreaker and finally The Stormlight Archive. I originally intended to stop there, but I also read Secret History somewhere in the middle, and it got me hooked up with all the connections, so I decided to dive in fully. 

I chose to go with Elantris next, since it came out first and apparently Sel plays a big part in the Cosmere, but I had read so many bad reviews I went with very low expectations. I guess that helped, because I actually enjoyed it! 
Now let me get started by saying that yes, you can definitely tell this is his first published work. The are some issues here and there, but the story was still quite solid! And I personally didn't find the characters as 'bland' as some people say.

I loved the beginning, because it goes straight into the story: Raoden is hit by the Shaod, Sarene has to take up Raoden's place and save the city and Hrathen is in Kae to convert (and save!) everyone. Brandon usually takes his time to begin the story. And sometimes it is needed, but others it drags a bit.

The story itself was really interesting, and I think the pacing was quite good. Some things didn't entirely make sense to me though: the whole Adien plot was absolutely unnecessary. I kept thinking something big was gonna happen with him and then... that. Also *why* would he know how many steps he is from any place does that ever get explained?? Raoden just casually measuring his steps in the middle of chaos had me cackling; Kiin being a pirate and his backstory with Eventeo was also like... just thrown in there. I mean, both things were foreshadowed, but sometimes that doesn't stop them from not making much sense. Other plot twists were well thought-out I think, like Iadon being part of a cult, Dilaf being a Dakhor or Ahan's treason (dumb one, but someone *had* to be a traitor). I think what bothers people the most is how easily most problems where solved, and I agree with some like, every time Sarene was doomed it was suddenly oh but [insert male character] was there and he saved her!! But other times I quite liked how they came to a conclusion fast.

The main issue we all found I believe, was how hard every name was to pronounce and remember. I kinda got used to it by the end, but I can see how it can be outputting and prevent people from diving into the world and story. I hardly remember most of the names and I finished reading a day ago lol (reading it in 2 days probably doesn't help)

Now onto the characters: many people call them 'bland', and I can see where they come from, but I don't completely agree. Hrathen wasn't bland at all, although I think people generally like him, so I won't expand much on him. I'll just say his arc was obviously well planned and it was easy to empathize with him throughout the whole book, I never saw him as a villain (and I think that was the point). I have to say him 'loving' Sarene was kind of unnecessary though, as they barely spoke. But I choose to believe that it was more infatuation and idealization than love (plus physical attraction).
I actually liked Sarene. she had clear self-esteem issues which, as a woman close to her age, I can totally relate to. I'm sorry but her worrying about never finding a person who will love and accept her for who she is? Real. Everyone making comments about her weight and height when there's nothing she can do about it, and feeling like shit but not saying anything back? Real. I think her personality was realistic overall. She was a natural leader, interested in politics and fencing, and people found that intimidating because it just wasn't what was expected of women. The main issue with her I guess, was that every other woman in the story was written as an airhead to make her look more special and it ended up making her a 'I'm not like the other girls' girl. But it was more of an issue with the other female characters. I guess it's true she doesn't have much character development, but I'm also a firm believer that's just not always needed. She has a good story arc and I think that's enough. Plus, she did learn to just accept how she is and how people see her, and she found someone who loves her for who she is so good for her !! She also learns she's not always as right about things as she believes, like when she goes to New Elantris, and characters like Roial show her how she often doesn't know when to stay in her place.
Raoden was cool too. People call him bland because he was just 'perfect', but he was perfect to the other characters, not to himself. Is he utterly optimistic? Yes, so? I thought it was refreshing to see, not every main character needs to be mentally ill and have traumatic experiences (I'm sorry and I love you Kaladin) to be a good main character. Raoden clearly struggles with staying optimistic though. Many times he starts to believe this society he's making in New Elantris is doomed and that everything is his fault, he just manages to get past through it and find hope and a way to solve things. And so many times he's about to give out to the pain, he actually *knows* he'll eventually give out, he just hopes he'll find the key to AonDor before or leave enough behind for someone to do it someday. I can see how Raoden is like a prototype character for other males in the Cosmere though, and that might take some people out if they've read them before.

Minor characters were pretty ok. The women were obviously left completely aside lol, except maybe Karata. Galladon was an interesting sidekick (definitely see some Teft in him), Karata and the rest of the Elantrians were ok. Roial, Eondel and Shuden were all good (though maybe too nice and convenient to Sarene's plot) and Lukel made me laugh quite a few times (the post-invasion scene when he's just lying wounded on the floor like 'im dead save the rest' and Raoden's like 'omg stop whining dumbass im trying to heal you' is one of my favorite moments actually). I felt like the little cousins were a bit unnecessary, they didn't need as much 'screentime' as they had at the beginning. Like, Kaise was developed way too much during the first part for a side character that barely shows up during the rest of the book? I found that odd (and I wonder if something was planned and scrapped for her). Dilaf was a good villain! It was expected he would be the actual villain, but I wasn't expecting *that* much lol (or even time for a small backstory).

I find in Elantris's ending the same issue I find in Warbreaker though: it leaves way too much room for a sequel, even if the main story is wrapped. I know there are 2 novellas though (but different characters and setting right?), so I'll have to read them before I say anything else. I also was expecting the ending to be bigger like, Shard-level big. But the shards were only mentioned in the Ars Arcanum.
Oh!! I also think Raoden and Serene are one of the best-developed romantic relationships of the Cosmere (of the ones I've read so far), which took me by surprise, because I thought they wouldn't see each other until the end of the book lol.

tldr: cosmere readers usually throw elantris under the bus, but it is actually a good and entertaining book, even if it has some issues. i actually liked the characters and story.

Potential far future of the Cosmere becuase of RoW,8,13u155e,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13u155e/potential_far_future_of_the_cosmere_becuase_of_row/,9,"Navani discovered a way to create Anti Light artificially(if thats how it should be considered?) (maybe it can be done in other ways as well?)

Does this open the possibility that happens in some fantasy, LOTR comes to mind, where things used to be more magical but ends up fading from the world/universe/Cosmere for reasons?

While the power of Shards could be considered infinite, given millennia, could civilizations start to chip away at the total amount of investiture in the Cosmere especially with Anti Light being used in the assumed upcoming inter planetary Shard wars.

That then leads to questions about Shard investiture vs other forms of magic from sources like Aethers. Is Aether magic also investiture and can an Anti Aether magic be created? 

Just rambling at this point. Hopefully what I'm getting at is understood.

For the sake of responses I think my questions are:

1. Will Anti Light lead to loss of magic in Cosmere?

2. Is Shard magic and Aether both investiture based?

3. If not will there be a way to destroy Aether magic like there is Shard investiture?

4. Bonus question- Has BS said how many different sources of magic exist in the Cosmere? Shards vs Aethers vs others?",1685282386.0

One of my players in my DND 5e game is a huge fan of the Stormlight Archives, what are some good monsters and items I can put in the game to surprise him?

Update: First, I want to say thank you to everyone for responding! This community is awesome!  The player in question missed the last session, so I'm holding onto it for next time, but I've decided to put a maze with a chasmfiend between them and one of their goals. The idea will be to safely navigate the maze while avoiding the chasmfiend, with certain alleys being too small for the creature itself to get through to make for hiding spots. Later on in the campaign, when they're appropriately leveled, I'll let them fight a chasmfiend head on and bring it down

For shardblade and shardplate, it'll have to be later on in the game but I'll eventually have a villain using those as a boss battle so the players can overcome them and get that sweet sweet loot. I'm still not sure how to include Hoid into the campaign yet, but it's such a cool concept and I feel like it's probably my favorite of the ones mentioned lol. And in time for the final battle I'll include Nightblood as an artifact, though that might end up being a reflavored sword of Zariel since artifacts are hard to homebrew

Just finished Elantris. Here are some quick thoughts.,55,13t9duk,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13t9duk/just_finished_elantris_here_are_some_quick/,28,"For context, I’ve just started reading Sanderson. So far I have read Mistborn era 1 and now Elantris.

I went into Elantris as I’m sure most of you have, with a preconception that the book will not be that great. More often than not, I saw opinions of Elantris that suggested it was Brandon’s weakest piece. I wasn’t very excited to start it, but I wanted to get it over with so I could get onto Stormlight.

Overall, I really enjoyed Elantris. I had a hard time with the pronunciation of names and locations at first, but I got over that hump by just rolling with how my mind phonetically sounded those words (if that makes sense?)

Hrathen is by far the best best character in that book. Such a level headed, misguided, and interesting character. I really hope we get more characters like him in future novels. His relationship with Serene was great, and his confession of love left me feeling incredibly sad for both him and Serene. I really liked his development and character arc.

Serene’s character bothered me most of the time. She’s very much a perfect character who doesn’t make many mistakes. I’d classify her as a Mary-Sue. It probably didn’t help that I occasionally listened to the graphic audio, which in my opinion, had a very annoying voice actor for Serene. Her character didn’t really stand out to me.

Similarly, Raoden felt like a very perfect character. He made some mistakes that I could sympathize with, but I didn’t really feel much empathy for both him and Serene. I liked his reveal at the end and his coming into Kingship/Elantrian powers, but overall I wasn’t very invested into his character. The most interesting part of his chapters were the mystery behind Elantris.

The magic system in Elantris is very cool, albeit a bit confusing and hard to picture at times, but the way it comes through in that finale was amazing.

I agree with the general sentiment that Elantris is a weaker novel, but out of a collection of great novels, the weakest one is still a great novel, in my opinion. I look forward to a sequel that hopefully fixes some of the more glaring issues, but overall I have to say Elantris was a fun read. I’m glad I got this one out of the way early, especially if it keeps getting better from here.

I’d love to hear what you guys thought of Elantris as well. I’m onto Warbreaker next, a few chapters in and I can already tell it’s setting up to be a good one!",1685198894.0

How much do we actually KNOW about Scadrial pre-Ascension?,21,13t9njp,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13t9njp/how_much_do_we_actually_know_about_scadrial/,10,"First off, forgive me if I'm forgetting something obvious; I'm re-reading era 1 now.  I've read *TFE* multiple times but the other two only once each. 

We get bits and pieces of lore about the time before the Lord Ruler's Ascension throughout Mistborn Era 1: the logbook in *The Final Empire*, the metal plate that Sazed does a rubbing of in *Well of Ascension,* and then a handful more metal plates in *Hero of Ages*, written by the Lord Ruler (or at his command anyway)*.* 

Of course, we find out relatively late in the game the significance of Kwaan's saying that ""anything not written in metal cannot be trusted"".  Which means that the ENTIRE logbook, and the rubbing Sazed takes, and even the contents of their metalminds are not reliable.  

So my question is, how much can Ruin change?  Is he tweaking words and phrases here and there, or does he fabricate entire sections?  Could the logbook have been, say, a cookbook, and when Vin grabbed it Ruin totally fabricated the entire series of journal entries to fuck with them?

(I don't actually think it was a cookbook that's just an example please don't make fun of me)

You'll need to download or copy this to your google account.  Then on the parameters tab, enter your start and end dates. You can also adjust the Kindle locations per page if you would like.  This sheet also calls out unknowns an assumptions.

On the book list tab, you can adjust the reading order you'd like but be careful to start at ""1"" and be sequential with no duplicates.

When all is said and done, the reading plan tab will tell you what book and page to start on every week, and where to end.

As published, the sheet is set up for my re-read of the cosmere with the priority of finishing Rhythm of War the week before we expect Knights of Wind and Truth to release.  It slots the secret projects to be read when released.  If that is your objective, no edits are needed to the sheet.

Edwarn tells wax that it was because of an unfortunate illness that struck his son, only in the narration there is a pause between unfortunate and illness (idk if it was written with an ellipses or not) 

We know that the set isn't afraid to set it's members against one another, or even to have their members kill to usurpe another position, as fake Wax and fake Wayne are all the proof we need of that. We also know that telsin had been in the set longer than Edwarn and had been the one to bring him in. However, Edwarns son would have been closer to wax and telsins age, and was also not officially one of the lord's who the set was trying to overthrow, unlike Edwarn, so wouldn't have made more sense for telsin to approach her cousin first? 

What I'm trying to get at is that: what if Edwarns son was supposed to be Mr. Suit/what if Edwarns son refused to be a part of the set. Either way when edwarn himself joined the set he would have seen his son as a threat, hell he gives telsin up for dead and looks forward to taking her position in Bands of Mourning, so we know that familial relations are secondary when it comes to gathering himself more power. 

I know this may seem unlikely given that no one tries to kill telsin in book 3 despite several people wanting her position, however telsin was also openly in favor, whereas 8 years before their position in the set may not have been as assured so there may have been less of a general protection. 

I definitely think that killing his son for the set would be a move that autonomy approved of in her own way, especially if his son refused to join the set.

Did *spoiler* lose Scadrial's moon?,376,13psp96,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13psp96/did_spoiler_lose_scadrials_moon/,66,"***Spoilers for all of era 1***

Completely trivial theory ahead

So going off of the assumption that moons are extremely common phenomena (given our solar system alone has 268 [""traditional"" moons](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/overview/)), I find it weird to think Scadrial **never** had a moon. As Sazed states in the [HoA chapter 5 epigraph](https://coppermind.net/wiki/The_Hero_of_Ages/Epigraphs) Rashek was sorta sloppy (or untrained, rather) when moving things around, so my theory is that when he flung Scadrial towards the sun he just forgot about the moon, thereby losing it to a millenium long drift through the cosmere.

&#x200B;

**EDIT: I cranked some numbers**

So in this following scenario Scadrial would be placed exactly in between the sun and the moon for the entirety of the duration of Scadrials crusade, so to speak. This would mean that the force working on the moon from Scadrial would be constant for the entirety of the voyage, whilst the sun's gravitational force would be changing in compliance with the inverse square law.

Assuming the cosmere standard for gravitation and size is the same as the earth, whilst knowing that [Scadrial is the most earthlike planet](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/100/#e3377), and that [its size and gravity](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Physical_Realm#The_Scadrian_System) ***is*** the cosmere standard we can do some math, by assuming the Scadrian moon and sun is the same as ours as well.

Bear with me here:

1. We start by finding the surface temperature of the moon lit by the sun using [this equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_temperature#Surface_temperature_of_a_planet) and plugging in the Stephan-Boltzmann constant, the moon's albedo and emissivity, the sun's luminosity, and assume the A\_abs/A\_rad to be 1/4 as a tidally locked (also assumed) moon's rotation is considered a ""fast"" rotation. Rearrange to solve for distance, and plug in feldspar's melting point ([\~1 500 Kelvin](https://www.chembk.com/en/chem/12003-63-3)). I'll use 1700 Kelvin, as i think the moon can withstand much more than it's melting point before it starts desintegrating completely. Now solve for distance. I get \~3.9E9 meters, let's call this distance **d\_melt**.We now know the distance from the sun at which the moon's surface starts to melt considerably.
2. Using the [equation for instantaneous velocity in a non uniform gravitational field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_for_a_falling_body#Equations), essentially just using K.E.= U(d\_initial) - U(d\_melt), I get **257 420 m/s**, which we'll call **v_sun**. Now we've got to calculate the velocity gained from Scadrial's positioning between the sun and moon. Since the distance between Scadrial and the moon is constant, and hence also the respective gravitational field, we can use the good ol' reliable v = sqrt(2gh), with h being **d\_melt**. From this we get an additional whopping 276 618 m/s. Adding this to **v\_sun** we're now at 534 038 m/s
3. The [orbital escape velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity#From_an_orbiting_body) of the sun at a distance of **d\_melt** away is 260 833 m/s, to which Scadrial adds 1447 m/s (allthough I'm not sure escape velocities are additive that way). Suffice it to say that moon is way outside of the Scadrian system

&#x200B;

Thoughts on the cognitive realm,21,13pd7ak,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13pd7ak/thoughts_on_the_cognitive_realm/,35,"My first set of thoughts on the cognitive realm: interplanetary travel should be much harder than it is portrayed as being in the mistborn secret history. My understanding was that when Kel ran to the Ire camp, he was nearly off Scadriel’s cognitive realm.  This was because he had ran into the ocean, where perception of the world ends. But, since planets are spheres, shouldn’t that have just transported him across the ocean rather than off planet? I can’t help but think that there would still need to be a component of movement perpendicular to the ground to leave the planet, even in the cognitive realm.

Second set of thoughts: Throughout Brandon’s works, the cognitive realm has been described as a place shaped by human perception and thought. I’m wondering if this might be a flawed description, though.

We are shown a number of intelligent non-human species across the cosmere, all just as or more capable of cognition than humans.

Seeing as the cosmere is God and soul agnostic, there is no reason to believe life is anything more than a complex clump of cells. Admittedly some life has a higher innate level of investiture. 

Here is my cognitive realm theory: it is shaped by all thoughts, and the impact of an individuals thoughts is determined by the quantity and depth of the individual’s thoughts. So, a singer’s thoughts should have a roughly equal impact on the cognitive realm.

Unless they somehow programmed into the spanreed that up off the page is defined as up.

Similarly, in Dawnshard, Rushu demonstrates to Rysn two rings that move opposite of each other. Why would they not slam into each other as the movement of the boat moves the first one forward, therefore moving the other one backwards. How are they able to lock their movement to their relative position on the ship deck rather then to the planet or to the galaxy even. If the rings were to lock their movement to their total movement then the one Rysn isnt holding would zip off into space at incredible speeds

This got me thinking of the shards and how their power is described as infinite. Previously I took this to mean that there was no end to their power which was why Harmony did not get twice as strong. Power Twice as endless is just as endless afterall.

Now I'm thinking differently, perhaps a Shards power is just complex and beyond our comprehension, After all Adonalsium must have been more powerful than any one Shard.

We of course understand Harmony's power more than most, having been given a more privileged insight than most in the Cosmere. His power is not double another shards as he is in conflict with himself.

However, I feel that this doesn't make much sense. First of all, feruchemy is literally about Preservation--where's the Ruin in that? Also, the story goes to great lengths to establish that Ruin's Intent is end-negative, and Preservation's is end-neutral, and they can only achieve a net positive by working together. So why is the net positive Magic system associated only with Preservation?

Cosmere Tattoo Idea / AonDork,5,13p224y,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13p224y/cosmere_tattoo_idea_aondork/,1,"Let me state for the record that I am extreme geek, and borderline dork.  I am also a software developer and a bearer of cosmere related tattoos.

I was trying to think of my next one and realized that for what I wanted, I do not have enough information.  

I need Aons inked on me somewhere.  But random Aons are not enough, I want an Aonic Equation/Program.

It gets worse as I considered *what* I wanted the program to be/do. My first thought was ""Hello, World!"" or ""Hello, Cosmere!"" in Aonic.  (""Hello World"" being the typical first program when learning any programming language). But then I realized something: since Aons can mimic almost anything in the Cosmere, one can assume that the proper Aonic equation can produce Aons.  So I could actually have a ""Hello Cosmere!"" equation/program as a tattoo.

This brought me to my next thought, an Aonic quine.  A quine is a program that does nothing more than produce itself.  So imagine a complex Aonic equation that, when activated, did nothing more than produce the exact same equation in the air 2 paces away.

Which led me to my final thought, and what I would actually get as a tattoo:

An Aonic Tattoo that, when activated, reproduced the tattoo on the one activating it, provided they do not have it already. 

This is multiple layers of self-referential and right up my alley.  It's a damn shame we don't yet have enough information to work this one out.",1684786926.0

Possible spoilers ahead for a new character that might appear in SA5.

So people who paid for all-in on the stormlight premium miniatures campaign already know this but Brandon had them add a mysterious bonus miniature for a character named Zellion. All we got was a silhouette of a menacing looking figure in what appears to be shardplate as well as some concept art where Zellion is holding a pearly white shardblade with armor the color of burning metal.

Now let me bring your attention to this WoB saying that this Zellion is based on the Zellion that appears in Brandons unreleased novel ""The Sixth Incarnation of Pandora""

https://wob.coppermind.net/events/508/#e16104

Basically its the same character but injected into the cosmere. From some other WoB's I've seen, Zellion in that book was a man who had been given so much power via technology that he became like a superweapon capable of wiping out armies by himself, and nearly indestructible. This came at the cost of his sanity. You can't find TSIoP published online officially but here is a small excerpt Brandon read

https://wob.coppermind.net/events/448/#e14437 

From this all we can really see is that Zellion is pretty thoughtful and has a companion that is basically his spren. Presumably this is before he went insane

I thought this was pretty interesting and makes me excited for the character. Perhaps hes some kind of fused that is the best fighter in all of Odium's army but has gone insane. Let me know your theories on how you think he will be implemented.

Bonus question: Zellion's shardblade is pretty unique, its very long and the blade has wiggles like a narwhal horn. It seems to glow white with an intricately designed pommel. Does this match the description of any blade we know of?",1684733985.0

Tin is for/of preservation, as heightened senses can be used to survive longer.
Pewter is for/of ruin, as a thug can cause great ruin and destruction.

Aluminum is preservation, extinguishing all metals means no more mistborn to destroy (cause their power is gone)
Duralumin is ruin, because look at that rusting steel push

You get the idea.  Do you think this changed in era 2?

Also, I have a similar idea with the surges on roshar:

Progression (regrowth) is of cultivation, as it encourages growth)

Adhesion is of honor, because oaths are binding (similar logic with gravitation)

Illumination is of cultivation, as things can grow when light is shined on them.

I think some knights radiant get surges that are 1 honor 1 cultivation, and some get surges that are 2 of honor or 2 of cultivation.  Maybe those ones can use different lights to power their surges?  One of these days I'll draw it out using a chart.

Mistborn and stormlight are unique because they're the only worldsets that have multiple shards.... well, except elantris, and the shards there are dead so that changes things.... and did they really interact?  Warbreaker only had endowment, white sand also only had 1 shard in play, as did threnody  (quiet and the spooks, I mean shadows of silence in the forests of hell).

Anyway, it's interesting to see the split from a stepped away view (as opposed to the close up view on the first read through).  I wonder what other blends shards and their magic systems will have, or if I'm on to something more....

Aside from the surges, all of the magic systems seem to boil down to the same basic 8-10 powers, just with different forms of fuel and sacrifice, with hemalurgy being the only outlier that messes it all up.

Silver in the Cosmere,39,13o5ja9,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13o5ja9/silver_in_the_cosmere/,25,"So I've noticed that Metals in the cosmere typically have similar effects regardless of the source of the Investiture they are interacting with or the planet they are native to. For example, aluminum always blocks Investiture, the basic allomantic metals have a 1-to-1 correspondence to their uses in fabrics mechanics, and iron and steel are even shown to have the appropriate push/pull reactions to aether growths in Tress.

The one exception to this rule seems to be silver. It is used on Threnody and Lumar to kill invested things (shades and aether spores, respectively), but Vin explicitly calls silver ""Allomantically useless"" in the original trilogy.

So does silver actually break this rule, or is it just that its reaction with Investiture doesn't manifest in Allomancy? I doubt it's another hidden metal, as there are already a solid sixteen.

But hold it, Dalinar didn't just trust him, he went so far as to dismiss what Kaladin was saying AND declared Amaram a knights radiant. Dalinar isnt that stupid, and Brando Sando isnt that thin. If Dalinar trusts Amaram, there would be a reason. If Amaram told Dalinar he had radiant powers, AND he's been playing Dalinar with the glyphs, AND Dalinar is desperate to recreate the knights radiant, he at the very least told Dalinar he had them and Dalinar was all too keen to get him on side no matter what anyone else said.

>!Anyway, everytime I get really certain I know where its going something reminds me ""yeah, because Brando Sando told you it would. But remember he also said ""wouldnt it be weird if"" or ""hold on, but what about this detail that doesnt add up?"" and you were so keen to see the first bit you forgot the implications of the second bit.!<

>!I think Amaram either has surgebinding powers, OR is lying to dalinar in such an extreme way that  Dalinar believes him wholeheartedly. He didn't care to keep up appearances where Kaladin leapt in, so I'm going with he has proof and only Dalinar knows about it.!<

>!Which ALSO means that while I'm sitting there hating Amaram for being a coward, he actually isn't. He COULD have WON, and Dalinar knows it, and he STILL chose to do nothing.!<

I also think Brando Sando makes me a conspiracy theorist who is inevitably telling people who have already read it how wrong he is and how insane he's going. But Brando Sando plants foreshadowing so double handedly that when he says ""its possible but na"" I think ""so Confirmed.""",1684684277.0
Live React (WOR Ch57),19,13o03e6,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13o03e6/live_react_wor_ch57/,1,"I really didn't intend to do so many, but its such good writing.and so much has happened. Chapter 57 deserved its own react.

>!""The fourth man (...) was waving his sword on the ground for some reason."" He's doing it again. Something is happening in the background but ignore it, it totally won't be a twist later...!<

>!""Renarin sat on the ground. (...) Had he been defeated? Kaladin had heard no announcement from the judges""!< I'm watching you sanderson...

>!""He would not last much longer""!< This is why exposition matters. Without it being remotely true, we cannot take the tensions its selling seroously. But if he tells me that, and I believe that, the stakes hold.

>!""Renarin! Yield!"" ""Storms, he'd been crying."" ""Instead, Renarin dismissed his blade."" ""Renarin closed his eyes, looking upwards, as if exposing his throat."" ... Poor Renarin. He knew it was a long shot going in 2 vs 4, but Adolin was bragging about taking on 2 and he couldn't take on 1. Kaladin jumps in like a hero, but Renarin must be feeling utterly useless. I don't think he beat a single one and even WITHOUT surrendering no one bothered with him, he just sat there useless while three people took on Adolin. Sure, Adolin has plate and blade, but seeing Kaladin jump in perfectly fine kills any sense of ""well its only because I didnt have plate/blade."" And when one finally does come for him, he thinks whats the point. He trained with Kaladin specifically for this and then the time comes and he couldn't land a single hit. He sits crying and no one notices. When we train for something, especially when we start, we feel so proud just to be able to attempt it at all that it becomes very easy to imagine how well we'll do given the chance. He probably thought he was doing the absolute noble thing, saving his brother, proving himself, and just ... nothing. Everything fist-bumpingly great about ""oh wow, Kaladin is finally doing something at risk of exposing his powers to the court"" is the heroic moment I'm sure Renarin thought he was about to get and then ... crushed. If Kaladin is the ""I'll just defend myself"" fantasy, Renarin is the ""They took my lunch money and there was nothing I could do"" reality.!<

>!When someone who hates your brother steps in and saves him from a fight of 4 people and you now would have mixed feelings because yay Adolin got saved but wow no thanks to you and in fact if Kaladin hadn't stepped in you'd be dead and feel like you deserve it.!<

>!Okay look. Its so weird because I study storytelling so I'm very often in a Meta-Gamey ""Narrative says"" brain, but I'm SO invested in what is going on with Adllin and Kaladin's ability to make plans and pull things off, but COME ON ADOLIN. YOU ALMOST DIED AND KALADIN SAVED YOU. QUITE FRANKLY, YOU SHOULD SIT THIS ONE OUT. I know that even Kaladin is like ""well that was the whole point"" but we JUST saw how easily Sadeas will find a loophole and ruin your plan, AND you're exhausted, AND even Kaladin is out of stormlight. Take the win and go home.!<

>!Okay. Renarin gave Kaladin some spheres. Adolin can switch plates. MAYBE this plan can work but we are close to an act climax and Sadeas is on a palpatine level cunning and just ... I don't TRUST it. I get the sense Kaladin is also going to challenge Amaram, but narratively it was a long shot just to win That one and do I really REALLY think Sanderson is the type of writer to let BOTH Adolin and Kaladin beat BOTH Sadeas and Amaram and the act end on a completely benevolent high note.!< I'm WATCHING you Sanderson. 😆 You sneaky sneaky genius.

>!""You have pleased your king greatly"" Okay. The judge was paid off and 6 people came near death. Moash may have a point, this king just doesn't get whats going on.!<

>!""And for my boon!"" Ooh hoo hoo. Chills. Same feeling I had earlier when Kaladin said ""Or do I get to kill my second Shardbearer?"" To quote Memento ""You're not a killer. That's why you're so good at it."" Narratively, its such a dark path for Kaladin, but ooh hoo I can't say I'm not looking forward to the IDEA of knocking Amaram down a peg. I'm 100% expecting Sanderson to pull something and reveal that Amaram in fact can match Kaladins powers and he has no chance. But a personal fail for Kaladin is a narrative payoff win for me, the audience.!<

>!I keep forgetting Book 3 is named after Sadea's blade. I plan to read Edgedancer first though.!<

>!Its one of those times were if it wasnt such a dangerous flaw in Kaladin I'd think he should just challenge the entire kingdom and be done with it. But its just good writing - everyone (even Dalinar, even Kaladin) has their blind spots. Seems to me that Shallan, Kaladin and Dalinar all have Amaram as a blind spot in common.!<

>!Ooh interesting, Sadeas rattled.!<

>!Ooft. Surprisingly, I have a lot less thoughts. Ch 58 and the act as a whole ends with a lot more of a interspectory vibe. Sadeas is up to something, Adolin and Kaladin's plan fell through. Amaram and Sadeas are hard to pin down, and in a way it backfired because Amaram now KNOWS what Kaladin is up to. He's played nice with Dalinar but Dalinar's faith in Kaladin may just push Amaram to openly join Sadeas.!<

>!Its crazy to think that though the book is split in two, I'm still only up to act 3 of book 2 with so much to go. But I like that the books are long and its like you're actually going through their lives with them, its not rushing towards each plot beat like it has an audience renention quota. Yet it rarely feels like its just plodding along; Where there isnt big reveals there's discoveries, where there isn't discoveries there's still implications and hints. It knows where its going and it takes its time to really build to it. And the way dynamics interchange it could easily go several different things and still play fair. If Sadeas is in control of some assasins, then maybe the people Moash answers to are under Sadeas's influence. Maybe Moash has been harbouring powers - ANYONE could really - and he'll challenge Kaladin under Sades's name. I feel like at some point Amaram, Sadeas or Dalinar has to kill one of the other, I know theyre baiting Sadeas having Dalinar faux-assasinated then Sades plans to tale him out, but rule one only dictate the plan if the plan will go awry. So theres every chance Amaram will turn on Dalinar, potentially kill Adolin, or Amaram may join Sadeas only to be betrayed. Ugh so much kingdomly politics with everyone being so hard to read, and Dalinar being so eager to trust Sadeas then Amaram and by the time he trusts Kaladin Kaladin has blown the plan to get revenge on his friend Amaram. 'what a tangled web we weave'.!<

>!Oh yeah, does what Sadeas said confirm that the parshendi in fact didn't send an assasin and it was in fact Sadeas? He implied theres more than one so may not be the same source. But I take the 'hint' that the parshendi dont have a concept of assasins as fact, then why the sudden cold shoulder to Dalinar? Did they just see through it and know it was Adolin and didn't like being tricked? I KNOW he""s probably laid it all out if I know WHICH vague hints to link together but I enjoy anticipation and predicting in real time, I struggle to go back over the books and figure out what direction future books will take.!<

>!Elhotkar is really losing it. He seems to be on Dalinars side, knew what Adolin would ask for, yet let the match continue when it was tanking and has expressed paranoia that Dalinar is trying to overthrow him or at the very least undermine him. I actually get why Kaladin is on the fence with Moash's people but simultaneously this kingdom is on very shaky ground. Dalinar/Adolin vs Sadeas/Amaram something's got to give and sway the battle one way or the other. Now that Amaram knows Kaladin is coming for him, he's the wildcard.!<

Just Finished The Lost Metal,8,13nydft,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13nydft/just_finished_the_lost_metal/,5,"That was the most fast-paced Cosmere book I’ve read so far. Felt like the pedal was floored the entire time. There were some things that didn’t seem wrapped up yet that really interested me.

The entire time I was expecting the bomb to have been in Daals airship. It seemed like the perfect Sanderson foreshadow twist to me. Wax literally entered the airship in the first few chapters, Daal is shown to have some hidden motives, and then they spend the next hundred pages talking about how the bomb needs some way to travel to Elendel, *had* to be the airship right? Surely the Set would be capable of recruiting Malwish agents.

Well apparently wrong. But I still think Daal was up to something or had some prior knowledge. His arrival was unbelievably timely, and included basically the only sure way for anyone to escape Elendel and survive the bomb. Steris even notes that when he is demanding the Malwish get the Bands after the Elend government uses them that he seems too prepared with how he’s talking.

If the bomb were to go off, that would put Daal in an incredible position. He would have the Elendel government as “guests” aboard his airship. He could easily strongarm the governor to declaring that Bilming had rebelled, but luckily Daal saved them, so now Varlance would “invite” The Malwish Consortium to put down Bilmings rebellion and “restore order,” with Daal or another Malwish as acting leader for the Basin. If they did manage to use the Bands and stopped the bomb, then his agreement guarantees that he gets to take the Bands back, and that guarantees the Malwish power over the Basin anyway.

But the question remains what side Daal is playing. If he did know about the bomb, which seems as likely as it does far-fetched, the way he benefits from these plans still puts him at odds with Telsins plan to unite the Basin and most likely fight the Malwish as Telsin would.

None of this really answers or even hints at the most important question the book leaves us with: Who drained the Bands? I’m truly out of ideas, but the only theory I can imagine is Hoid. We know he’s looking for power all over the Cosmere, and we can see that he was ingratiating himself to Wax and crew for months around this same time. As well as pointing Wax in the direction of the Bands in the third book. It’s not clear how he would manage to find them, but Kandra were regularly around Wax and company, so perhaps he managed to tail them back to where they hid it?

I feel truly sad to leave this crew behind. Wax deserves retirement, but I hope we get to see them all and the impact they’ve made down the line again even if only as side characters. I’m most excited to see what the southern continent is like.",1684684031.0

What was Hoid up to during the [spoilers],192,13n6i7x,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13n6i7x/what_was_hoid_up_to_during_the_spoilers/,58,"What was Hoid up to during the Desolations?

Hoid has some quirk of Fortune to make sure he's in the right place at the right time, he knows where a pivotal event will be so he can be there ready to influence significant events. He's older than The Shattering so must have been alive and world-hopping during the Desolations. Did he visit Roshar during that time?

I'm thinking about Talenelat'elin's ramblings which are his message to people to prepare for the next Desolation:

>*We must prepare. You will have forgotten much, following the destruction of the times past. Kalak will teach you to cast bronze, if you have forgotten this. We will Soulcast blocks of metal directly for you. I wish we could teach you steel, but casting is so much easier than forging, and you must have something we can produce quickly. Your stone tools will not serve against what is to come.*

He's expecting people to have reverted back to the stone age. Another of his rants talks about an idea that Ishar had to help mankind retain information between Desolations - referring to the Knights Radiant. So there were several Desolations when mankind was flailing helpless and ignorant, regressing back to the stone age between massive wars that decimated the population. Then there were several Desolations where the Knights Radiant had phenomenal magic power and were highly revered figures between the wars, passing down knowledge recorded in ages past. 

What would Hoid be doing during this time? It was an opportunity for him to become a Knight Radiant. Or just to use his vast knowledge to become an advisor to a king, that's also one of Hoid's favourite activities. Maybe he DID become a Knight Radiant prior to the Recreance? That would be an odd twist of fate if Hoid comes across a Shardblade in Stormlight 5 and he recognises it as his old spren from millenia ago?",1684613722.0

Roshar has had a long peaceful time to build up wealth. By wealth I’m not so much meaning cities and industry, though that kind of factors in. They’ve been raising chulls and harvesting gems for 2000 years. Even with what wars were lost, the survivors are sent out to gather spheres after the fact. There are simply more batteries for Stormlight kicking around than during any other desolation. The amount of storage is likely several times greater than at any other time. Squires who had to practice empty like normal foot soldiers don’t have to this time around. The Everstorm won’t charge gems unless Odium wants them to, but the Highstorms will charge all left out and there are just TONS more now. I guess what I’m trying to say is that I think that the amount of gas to power the war is greater and maybe that is what will make this one so much more destructive, not just the addition of a new storm mechanic.",1684590142.0

Things that stuck out to me:

>!Kaladin's instincts have been pretty on point. Ever since he survived the storm and saved the bridgecrew, I've been pretty 'whatever he says goes' and I find it interesting that while Adolin and Shallan get along and Kaladin and Shallan don't, with Adolin shallan still has her Veil up to an extent and Adolin isnt questioning it, whereas Kaladin distrusting her is a symptom of him seeing right through her. I don't tend to ship characters as a hobby, but this makes me feel like its perfectly enemy to lovers trope (which I know Brando Sando enjoys some classic romance trope) and on top of that, Kaladins instincts being so on point make me dislike Adolin on principle; no matter how much Adolin is doing what Dalinar asks, Kaladin instinctively trusted Dalinar but detested Adolin, so theres something there... I know how Brando Sando likes to sell you one thing then make that thing a big character-driven mistake and tear it apart to teach characters a lesson (i.e. what happened to Shallans last romance)!<

>!I do tend to forget things though. So much happens that I can remember big things that progress over time, but something like Wit - I remember the character, but couldnt tell you what he's done or said so far, and until Shallan hugged Wit I couldn't have told you they'd met.!<

>!Lines like ""What am I saying? Flirt with the girl, Kaladin  It might male tbe prince's eyes bulge"" encourage my case because Kaladin doesnt ever say he's not attracted to her. The only reason he gives is ""She's lighteyed"" and then ""I'd sooner flirt with a chasmfiend"" in a 'thou doth protest too much' kind of way. ""This woman was different."" Like I get Kaladin is distrusting of lighteyed people in general, and she was rude to him upon arrival, but also he's extremely protective of Adolin for someone who doesnt like him much, and he's on the verge of letting Moash's people do their thing and hasnt reported it so he's not 100% loyal to the crown. Like he's REALLY noticing her and struggling to look away. He dislikes Adolin, and yet it has all the markings of a jealous love triangle. Maybe I'm reading into it, but the alternative is Shallan and Adolin live happily ever after and Kaladin learns to inherently trust everyone. Seems a bit too narratively weak for a series that intends to have 8 more books after this one. Something has to go majorly wrong and all signs point to Adolin doing something that ruins the relationship and Shallan bonding with Kaladin instead. (Also just, theyre both P.O.V protagonists whereas Adolin has this expendable third party role that could go either way. Brando was already willing to kill off Jasnah just for Shallans plot to develop.)!<

>!""They were happy and pleasant. Why did that annoy him?"" One of his lectures literally has Brando Sando saying ""if you want to foreshadow something going wrong, you can have a character just feel like something is off and hint to your readers something is out of place."" He does similar when Shallan thinks ""history only ASSUMES parshendi worship them as gods"" as a blatant 'So we're claiming that but its not that'!<

>!Secondly, the plot to outsmart Sadeas ... also feels too early and too easy. Kaladins instincts again are ""He'd never agree."" so I'm fully expecting Sadeas to pull something.!<

>!Dalinar appointing Amaram to lead the Knights Radiant (when my theory is Amaram is the one leaving the glyphs to begin with and is enemy no.1 of BOTH shallan and Kaladin) has ""Eric has agreed to marry the sea witch"" vibes. Just ... no. What is Dalinar thinking?!<

SO thankyou for reading and sorry my thoughts are long, but if I was Brando Sando writing this based on the setups I've seen so far:

>!I would have Adolin challenge Sades to the duel, and EITHER Sades agrees, Kaladin has a sense of ""uh oh, wait, why?"" and then Sades beats Adolin, OR Sades does indeed apoint someone, at which point I'd have him appoint Dalinar. I dunno if he can Force Dalinar to fight in his place, but it could easily be a rule. Ch.55 states Adolin thinks people Expect Him To Cheat, so if Dalinar just folded to let Adolin win, Sades would lose his shards but win the war implying Dalinar doesnt fight with honour. But if Dalinar fought Adolin, I'd have Dalinar reluctantly win. Either way, either Dalinar or Sadeas would beat Adolin, Adolin would lose his shards, (or just as bad, Adolin would beat Dalinar and Dalinar's fighting reputation would be ruined and Adolin's ego would skyrocket) and then his ego and his womanizing would be so fractured that his relationship with Shallan would go dark. Meanwhile, we've got Shallan slipping away from Adolin, Kaladin and Shallan both investigating Amaram, so somehow they'd end up discovering each others secrets, and end up conspiring together on how to take Amaram down, only now they'd both be doing it behind Dalinars back because Dalinar wholeheartedly trusts Amaram I guess despite what Kaladin told him. Kaladin and Shallan would grow close, but Shallan is stuck in a betrohel she no longer wants and Kaladin is stuck guarding a kingdom he no longer wants.!<",1684607813.0

WOR Chapter 52. Wow.,29,13m325c,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13m325c/wor_chapter_52_wow/,8,"This may be my favourite chapter yet. The reveals and character development, back and forth P.O.V. felt so climactic I was convinced the act was ending. 

But now what I know of >!Amaram's connection to Shallan on top of the implication HE may have written the glyphs(?) right after Dalinar blamed himself and then declared war on all parshendi... if not also for Adolin's revenge mission on Sadeas, I don't know what I'm more excited for but its like a lot of information came together at once to imply some things Im not even sure the story spelled out so I may have interpreted wrong. All I know is I'm heavily anticipating Kaladin dueling Amaram and Adolin dueling Sades and I know in both cases the story is saying ""thats effectively going to corrupt their characters though."" but I'm also keen to see either duel the assassin or each other or ... anyone. For all I know Kaladin will end up dueling Dalinar or Dalinar will end up challenging Sades himself. So many options, and i find it fascinating that Shallan and Adolin both individually disliked Kaladin but the amaram reveal means Shallan now can understand where he's coming from and Adolin/Kaladin both have that revenge mission mindset. Theres a nuanced dynamic happening there but it makes me wonder then why Shallan and Adolin instantly like each other if ... in my mind Shallan / Kaladin eventually have to bond but what does that mean for Adolin, does he grow to like Kaladin or grow to like Shallan less...I really like their relationship already but in my head Adolin was a hot-head who was going to somehow ruin everything and now I just want everyone (except sadeas and amaram) to be happy.!<

Hoid in Randland (Cosmere/Wheel of Time Crossover) - Insults,0,13n2pns,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13n2pns/hoid_in_randland_cosmerewheel_of_time_crossover/,2,"Young trainees were all separated from the Novices and even the Accepted. The only ones walking beside the Aes Sedai were their own Warders, and yet, especially on occasions such as this one, Aes Sedai preferred to be distanced from them, standing beside their sisters. However, the Aes Sedai were all gathered around the table of the Amyrlin Seat, so the young men and women of the Tower all had a bit of time for themselves. Some pairs were very lovely to Min, while others probably should have never been made - she heard quite a lot of insults between them, but just from women, of course. 


Min herself was approached by few men. Some she actually found very charming and handsome, like the young Hardol, who was even interesting and witty, unlike most others. However, it was all just that - interesting conversations and nothing more. 


*Light burn you, Rand al'Thor, Light burn you!*


How dare he stay in her mind even when leagues away? When she sees him next time - which she *will* - she will either slap him or hug him. It will depend on the situation, of course.


The conversations going on inside the Tower were almost every day just whispers and arguments, petty squabbles hidden behind the veil of manners, between men and women alike and those whispers were in anything but good faith. The only person who made the evening so bright, at least for some, was the only man not speaking in hushed tones, for everyone to hear him. He was also the only man allowed to sit at the table with the most respected of the Aes Sedai and to be quite open in his words.


""Oh, Katerine Sedai! I think I have never seen a woman of such noble attitude as yourself. I must applaud you for even coming while I'm here - few men have ever had such bravery. Alviarin Sedai, I will take your presence here as a great compliment - having such an important person as yourself is flattering! Lady Rubinde, I would say you look gorgeous today, but I suppose the woman you see in the mirror every day has given you enough compliments for an entire year. And you, Elaida Sedai, you remind me of a person that was very dear to me.""


Elaida's lips were shut, and it was obvious that behind them she was gritting her teeth. ""Oh? I am honored.""


""I would say the same, but I think my cat would have been insulted by the comparison to you. But alas! It is just me making an observation!""


Elaida's face twisted. She stood up, pointing at Siuan Sanche. ""This kind of arrogance has never been the way to talk to an Aes Sedai! Mother,"" and she barely mouthed that. ""you cannot seriously tell us we will endure this...filth for much longer?""


The Amyrlin Seat shrugged, surprisingly simple. ""I like him. He brought some kind of humor to our Tower, Elaida, and it seems to me, from the way you take it so hard, that we desperately needed some of it."" 


""Oh, I wouldn't say needed, Mother!"" said Hoid, the man who, by all accounts, might have even been older than any Aes Sedai. ""I would say my presence here has probably gave all the men and women a breath of fresh air they desperately needed.""


The Red sister cussed. ""Mother, other men are lovely compared to this...thing you have taken as your advisor.""


""Ah, well, I shall consider myself a peacemaker then!"" said Hoid. ""Filling the gap between the side the Red Ajah and the whole of mankind? I will become a legend in your world yet again! I really should stop coming here, I'm afraid I change everything too much.""


Elaida cussed again, then pushed her chair and left the hall. Min was not certain if Hoid was brave or if he was stupid. Brave because, indeed, no one else, man or woman, dared to look an Aes Sedai in the face and insult them the way he did - that even left an effect on young men and women of the Tower. Two days ago, a young Novice spoke to an Aes Sedai using her name, without adding 'Sedai' aftewards - nearly all of the Aes Sedai blamed Hoid for such arrogance arising in the Tower. There were a few who actually laughed at his insults, and those he seemed to actually respect somewhat.


Yet, none of the Aes Sedai dared to actually confront him - he was the Amyrlin Seat's advisor, and practically able to say anything he wanted.


And though the others might have found Hoid amusing, Min always felt uneasy - not because of his wits and insults, which she actually found hilarious most of the time, but because she could never see auras around him. No viewings, no thread seen in the Pattern, nothing. For every person, she had seen something at least once, but never for Hoid. The gleeman was completely invisible to not just the Aes Sedai, but even to her, as if the Pattern of the world had no effect on him whatsoever. And that is what made him terrifying.


""Oh!"" He almost slipped, walking beside Elza Penfell. ""Oh, I am terribly sorry, my lady! And yet, I must ask you to send my regards to lovely lady Nemene when you meet her. I have not seen her in a long, *long* time!""


Elza went pale.",1684608222.0
Some theories for the stormlight series,1,13mlmd3,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13mlmd3/some_theories_for_the_stormlight_series/,2,"Spoilers for stormligjt series 


So I have 4 theories re-reading (listening) the whole storm light series. I'm re reading words of radiance currently and it's been a couple months since I have read the whole series.



1) the bonds allow for shardplate at a certian point. I believe that the spren that make up the plate are of a lesser spren that will coordinate with the order of knight radiant. 

Ex.) Shallan attracts creationspren more than typical
Kaladin attracts windspren- he believed syl to be a windspren at first (why I thought of it). Sylvia calls them her cousins I think? 
Jasnah has plate Made from logic spren!

There's only a few good examples and orders really represented so far, but I think we may have seen Kaladin use windspren as a shield at the end of ROW. 


2) Siah aimians are somehow related to elsecallers. Both cast shadows the wrong way. 

Maybe both are just closer to the cognitive realm than is normal. Axies (and all aimians) seem to be imortal so I have a feeling that the closeness to the cognitive comes intuitively to both. 

3) The main characters that are radiant delve from the traditional abilities of their order in some way. This may mean that they are beyond or in some way separate from their orders. 

Ex) Shallan is really bad at soulcasting. Compared to other lightweavers she was overseeing, she cannot make edible food. 

Lift (although nightwacther influence might be a factor) cannot glide as gracefully as other edgedancers and instead has to slide around on her knees using her hands to steer.

Seth may be the next budding factor we see. He seems to distinguish more between the spirit and the letter of the law better than other skybreakers. 

Jasnah was deeply afraid of shadesmar. She almost refused to show shallan how to handle the realm. However jasnah was an amazing soulcaster. Anything inorganic jasnah could make 

I wonder if it is Honor and/or Cultivation that changed how they specifically interact with their powers or if it is simply spren personalities and conflict with the radiant spren and the radiant. 

What is sanderson going to do with them other than make them say more oaths and become better. Will they become better at the talents they are supposed to have though?

4) Each order has a specialty.  Of course every order has 2 talents. Most definitely the radiant orders present different power sets when the surges are combined but I think each attribute for the orders differs in how strongly they present in the cognitive vs physical realm 

I have a feeling that elsecallers are better at transformation for inorganic material (objects) and lightweavers will be better at organic (people/food). You can see this with jasnah vs. Shallan (only clear example so far) jasnah cannot transform inorganic material as easily, she told shallan as much before she soulcast the jam. Shallan cannot will stick to become fire but easily makes  a goblet of liquid into blood on her first try.

I think it will hold the same for the other orders. Progression is easy for wyndle in the cognitive realm and easy for lift in the physical, however she struggles with abrasion.. Honorspren in the cognitive realm walk on all sorts of surfaces and Kal + others can in the physical I think they are more in line with adhesion vs. skybreakers which I think will prove to be better with gravitation in the physical realm.",1684569432.0

Rhythms Mistborn/Stormlight,68,13lk9mx,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13lk9mx/rhythms_mistbornstormlight/,14,"I’ve been reading Mistborn recently, and I think it’s interesting how many things on Scadrial are described as having specific rhythms. When burning bronze, each of the Allomantic powers is said to have a distinct rhythm (the rhythms of Preservation?), and at one point Marsh notes that each of his spikes throbs rhymically in time with his emotions (the rhythms of Ruin?). The Well of Ascension is also said to have given off rhythmic pulses. 

It just makes me wonder if all shards and all shard worlds have their own rhythms, and how important those rhythms are going to end up being to the Cosmere at large.

Shaladin vs. Shaolin -- Kaladin vs. Adolin,200,13l2bts,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13l2bts/shaladin_vs_shaolin_kaladin_vs_adolin/,109,"Adolin was always going to be a better match for Shallan than Kaladin could be.

The scene in WoR in the chasms during the highstorm, they shared an intimate moment. I think it was the intimacy of revealing their hidden vulnerabilities. That's powerful and intimate and connecting, but not *necessarily* romantic.

Veil's attraction to Kaladin's brooding is more of a superficial, less mature attraction. It's an infatuation.

Adolin truly cares about *her*, who she is. He's interested in the deepest parts of her, with caring and compassion and patience, especially by the end of OB.

Adolin simply has a lot more emotional intelligence than Kaladin. Kaladin's character's journey is a solitary one. Adolin's journey has always been about how he relates to other people: his father, his failed romances, dueling opponents, his constituents/subjects as a highprince.

&#x200B;

And, the scene where Adolin says he will always protect her and never let anything bad happen to her, and she responds with ""don't you ***dare*** do that"". She is dedicated to her agency, she stands up to him, demands her own personhood. She's willing to fight for her own free will at the expense of anything else.

Kaladin... oh, dear Kaladin. His insistence on protecting everyone could be seen as him treating people like objects more than people. It doesn't allow for people to protect themselves, or make their own choices; if it's his fault whenever someone dies, then his actions are the only ones that matter, so that person's actions don't matter either. If he's responsible for everyone, then no one is responsible for themselves. Shallan will always be responsible for herself, for better or worse.

&#x200B;

I love so much about his writing, the prose, the magic systems, the characters, the lore, but there is one thing that I have issue with. 

There have been several times where something has been so strongly implied that I go ""oh! that's really good 'show not tell'!"" but then the characters don't understand it, and then later they ""realize"" it and its treated like a big reveal.

Tress had the worst example of that IMO, Huck tells her that those who are cursed cannot talk about how to cure their curse, but he tells her you can still find information by figuring out what they can not talk about. So then she talks to Hoid, and uses the fact that he cannot talk about the location of the sorceress's island to figure out where the island is. I go ""oh! ok, so (at least part of) removing his curse involves getting to the sorceress's island."" And then whenever she's planning what to do when they get to the island, figuring out Hoid's exact cure never comes up. It was throwing me the whole time, and then at the climax, she suddenly realizes that Hoid needs to get to the island. Tress is one of my favorite Sanderson book, and may honestly end up being my favorite once I digest it for longer, but that was so frustrating at the time it really soured my mood at the end.",1684466518.0

Kenton and TwinSoul,12,13l8pfg,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13l8pfg/kenton_and_twinsoul/,14,"I've only just gotten to the part in Lost Metal when Marasi meets TwinSoul so I don't know much about him or what else happens in the rest of this book so please be careful with any spoilers about events later on in the book.

My big question is, does anyone think TwinSoul might be Kenton? Nothing on Kentons wiki page says anything other than the events from White Sand and when I briefly glanced at TwinSouls wiki non of the other aliases he goes by list Kenton.

My reason for thinking this pretty much only comes from TwinSouls description in Lost Metal. When Marasi first sees him she says: 

>""judging by the long powder-white mustache and the liver-spotted skin, which was a deep tan.""

Then later when TwinSoul changes clothing he's described: 

>""wearing a backpack that she thought—from the way it moved, and from the hose draped over his shoulder—might be filled entirely with water. He’d changed outfits, and now wore some kind of loose-fitting uniform with a bright yellow sash around his waist. He’d strapped on a sword—a slightly curved one in an ornate golden sheath.""

I think the description of the water filled backpack and uniform with a bright yellow sash couldn't describe anything other than a sand master. With the inclusion of the deep tan skin and that he has a sword, it seems to me that it would have to specifically be Kenton.

If I'm wrong about this please feel free to just RAFO me, but I can't seem to get over the similarities between TwinSouls description and Kenton",1684438910.0

What are they? In TLM we hear an Aetherbound claim that they're older than Adonalsium, but Brandon has made it clear this is merely what this character believes/ has been taught.

I wondered, what if the Aethers are a shattered God just like Adonalsium?It could be the malevolent force that was in direct opposition to Adonalisum, but that doesn't feel right. The Aethers also use investiture, so my crackpot theory is that, if they were once a joined God, that it was a partner to Adonalsium.

Could Adonalsium have shattered them him/herself? Could it have >!splintered itself like Virtuosity did?!<

Could their 'breakup' have caused Adonalsium to change, thus leading to the group wanting to shatter Adonalsium.

Plenty of people have speculated that Hoid could be Adonalsium's son.We also know that Hoid wanted to bring someone back from the great beyond. What if it's his Mother, who bore this second power? It would be an interesting allusion to the LDS theology of Heavenly Mother.

Edit\*[https://wob.coppermind.net/events/509/#e15989](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/509/#e15989)

That WoB suggests that Aethers and Adonalsium were similar entities (according to the Aethers). While it's a biased view, I think it adds a little more credibility to the theory. Maybe the Aethers weren't equal, but maybe if they had been combined before they were?  


[https://wob.coppermind.net/events/509/#e15922](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/509/#e15922)

Own idea/theory/Speculations about Harmony in Era 3(Spoilers TLM),21,13kgi2f,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13kgi2f/own_ideatheoryspeculations_about_harmony_in_era/,5,"These days I have been toying with the idea of the theory that Sazed will become Discord, and I have come up with an idea of how Era 3 of Mistborn could end, in case Discord becomes a reality.  


My idea is that, repeating what happened in the origins of Scadrial, Sazed, trying to stop being discord and become harmony again, what he would do is give a part of Ruin to all scadrians, just like Conservation did at the beginning.

&#x200B;

In this way, Sazed could recover the Harmony in his splinters, in addition to this having more possible and hypothetical effects on humans on the planet.

The first would be that, now that they have a part of Ruin in them, Harmony could communicate with everyone without the need for hemalurgical nails (now all the scadrians would be in harmony, just like their shard).

Of course, I think this would have something negative: And it would be that, now that they are equal, it could be that the frequency of allomantic powers would become even more scarce, although in contrast, those of feruchemy would increase (since the latter is the combination of both investitures).

Of course, there could be a way to compensate for this of allomancy: With the medallions of those of the south that can store allomancy, and with the new nails that they presented in TLM, where they said that, combining the residual investidure of conservation of several people, they could create a hemalurgical nail of allomantic powers.

Another effect that occurs to me from this would be that, with this new investidure of Ruin in people, the case of what happened in Era 1 could once again occur, according to the Ars Arcanum of Lost Metal, where they said that in Era 1, Because of Ruin's influence on living beings, it was possible to have several hemalurgical powers at the same time.

This at least is a theory that I have of how Scadrial's theme could be at the end of Era 3 onwards.

Stormlight 5/Future Cosmere Theory,164,13j7ra1,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13j7ra1/stormlight_5future_cosmere_theory/,113,"I'm new to reading Sanderson, and just recently finished reading all the books in the Cosmere. I was thinking through what might happen in Stormlight 5 and wanted to run my theory by you all.

One thing I love about Sanderson's writing is the foreshadowing that comes as a result of his long-term, detailed planning.  His stories follow patterns as well, and I think we can look at patterns in the Mistborn books to see what might happen in Stormlight.

One pattern I see potentially repeating itself is in the similarities between Sazed and Dalinar. Sanderson was very detailed when describing Sazed's journey to becoming the Hero of Ages, and emphasized how his life's work studying religion made him the perfect candidate to take up both Ruin and Preservation and balance them to become Harmony.

It seems that Dalinar has been foreshadowed in a similar way to Sazed. He learned to overcome his addiction to the Thrill (which we know was Odium's influence) through adherence to oaths (influenced by Honor and his bond with the Stormfather). 

What I'm seeing is a parallel between Sazed's history that prepared him to take up both Ruin and Preservation to become Harmony, and Dalinar's history that is preparing him to take up both Honor and Odium (and maybe Cultivation? Not sure about that yet. Maybe Navani takes up Cultivation at some point?)

We know that Honor has been splintered, but my theory is that Dalinar will reforge Honor through his Bondsmith abilities and also take Odium from Taravangian, becoming a being like Sazed (Harmony).

Then some long-term crazy guesses based on this theory:

* I think Dalinar will also use his Bondsmith abilities (and potential Honor/Odium abilities in cooperation with Cultivation) to ""forge"" a united Roshar where singers and humans live in peace.
* Dalinar, holding both Honor and Odium, and his team from Roshar join up with Sazed and other Shards across the Cosmere in an effort to reforge Adonalsium using Dalinar's Bondsmith abilities.
* The may need to select a person who could become the new Adonalsium. Maybe we know this person already, or maybe they'll be introduced later. What if this person comes from Scadrial as a result of The Set's ""breeding program"" to get the ultimate Mistborn person? We have a TON of Mistborn books still to come. I would expect this person to go through a wide range of experiences that would prepare them to hold all the Shards at some point in the future.
* The Cosmere is currently in total chaos, and I expect this Cosmere epic to conclude with some sort of Cosmere-wide ""harmony"". I think Marasi's role in this has been foreshadowed as well, since her personal interest is in designing the perfect society so that crime is eliminated because all people live comfortably and there is no longer a need to commit crime.

Anyway, sorry for the long post. I just had a bunch of ideas I wanted to get out there.  Like I said, I'm new to this so please correct me if any parts of this theory are way off or have already been debunked.",1684249479.0

Just finished Mistborn era. My thoughts:,11,13iw63r,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13iw63r/just_finished_mistborn_era_my_thoughts/,51,"So I just finished Mistborn era 1 for the first time. Overall I think this was a great trilogy, though I still can say I preferred the Stormlight Archives. Here’s some of my broad notes: 

The Good
- the magic systems were fantastic, as expected. I felt like the mystery of the different allomantic powers/metals and the other magic systems played out in an incredibly satisfying way throughout the series. The systems were explained so well that by the third book I was accurately making predications about plot twists, which is something I normally am really bad at. I guessed toward the beginning of HoA that Vin’s earring was a hemalurgic spike, guessed early on that Spook was spiked by the sword, and I guessed the connection between the times she called on the mists before the reveal happened. All of this was incredibly satisfying. 

- I really like Sanderson’s more simplistic prose. He does a great job of setting scenes and describing action without getting lost in the fluff. 

- The character work was fantastic. I enjoyed basically all of them, but Sazed and Vin were my favorites. 

- the overall plot was a rollercoaster that had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. 

The Bad
- I can’t say there was much “bad,” but the ending of HoA felt very rushed. It seemed like a whole lot happened in a very short amount of time, and not much of it was given the reverence it deserved. I felt like everything that happened from the time Vin became preservation onward just happened incredibly fast and I sort of was left at the end of the book with a feeling that it wasn’t quite as satisfying a conclusion as I was hoping. 

The Ugly
- this section is all mostly personal stuff that I might get blasted for, but I really felt that the third book, and the ending especially, was super heavy handed with the religious doctrine. I am aware of Sanderson’s religious beliefs, and I can’t fault someone for having beliefs, but the heavy-handedness of the Christian god allegory really detracted from the ending, at least to me. I personally found the “Terris religion was the real truth, but these other ones had some things that were good” view to be a bit distasteful and a bit obvious in its allegory when viewed through the lens of historic Christianity. 

- I personally disliked the way the story leans heavily on the “great man” fallacy, at least to my impression. Normally, I can ignore the presence of inherently harmful systems government (like monarchy) in fantasy, since most fantasy never actual questions the ethics of it. However, in a story that does go out of its way to approach political philosophy (and has a whole first book devoted to overthrowing an oppressive government) I can’t just dismiss it. The way the story basically shrugs and says “yeah emperors probably aren’t good but Elend is a good guy so it’s ok” just really hit me wrong, and the weird Lord Ruler apologia in the third book also left a bad taste in my mouth. We’re basically told by the characters that “the lord ruler was actually an alright dude who just did some bad things but with good intentions” which just made me cringe a bit. It also was strange to me just how quickly the concept of democracy was dismissed, but maybe it makes a comeback in the second era, I don’t know yet.

Ultimately, Sanderson’s religious ideology does show through in the way he approaches political issue, and he seems to be oddly resistant to questioning the ethics of centralized power structures outside of the idea that they are only bad because bad men are in control. Obviously, it’s a world where the idea of non-centralized power is not as widespread as the real world, but I wish it would not have been so soundly dismissed by the third book.

The next part then reminded me of Queen Tsa of Natanatan 'saw her abthing on the rrof and her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you' - Queen Tsa, according to Hoid, 'swapped places with the moon Mishin and became pregnant by Notom' - theorised to be a swap with Koravellium Avast (Cultivation) leading to pregnancy by Tanavast (Honor), breaking Tanavast's vows to his lover Koravelium, leaving the Vessel and the Shardic Intent at odds and weakening him for Rayse (Odium) to strike.

[All] Speculation about Harmony going forward into Era 3. Not sure if this is a popular theory.,8,13iepaa,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13iepaa/all_speculation_about_harmony_going_forward_into/,5,"Basically I got a very bad feeling from The Lost Metal. I think the reader was supposed to be reassured by Kelsier not seeing the shadowy double with Harmony. I felt the exact opposite. I think it not appearing means that it has fully taken over Sazed. We see him straight up lie during this conversation and Kelsier is very unnerved by his behavior. Kelsier wonders why Sazed would let this go so far and Sazed has no good answer other than ""you haven't seen what I've seen.""

I think this has been ongoing for a while. Sazed is priming Scadrial for a horrific war in the future, because what could be more discordant than humans killing each other in the biggest conflict the world has ever seen? He will be the main antagonist in Era 3. He was on the heroes side in Era 2 because Autonomy was interfering in his plans.

Frankly I doubt a lot of what he's been saying too...was he really blinded? Or did he just let this happen? Or did he forsee the blinding itself and allow that to happen?

Did he drain the bands too? I don't see how that could have happened with his cooperation.",1684172204.0

These metal men - Kalkis - sound an awful lot like Kalad’s Phantoms from Warbreaker, who were automatons built out of corpses and statues. 

In the later stories in the Lost Metal, she also competes with Nazh for a metal device that can transport someone between realms. Given spren are still Roshar-locked at this time, it cannot be a fabrial but rather some kind of AI from Nalthis able to open a small perpendicularity.

This raises a question of how much trade must have gone on between Scadrial and Nalthis during the time of the Lord Ruler? And if the Five Scholars traded with the Lord Ruler, what could they have possibly gotten from Scadrial? Atium? Knowledge of hemalurgy that inspired Nightblood?

I reckon this broadsheet also presents some possible foreshadowing for Autonomy’s golden army in the climax of The Lost Metal, the robots used by the Sorceress in Tress, and even the current plot of ‘Boatload of Mummies’ involving her discovering a book (with commands?) capable of raising of an army of the dead.

OoO


""The Dragon! Al'Thor!"" The cries continued without ceasing. ""The Dragon! The Dragon is reborn!""


""For a hundredth time, maybe."" Hoid muttered. ""I wonder how many times it will happen again?"" This world was certainly interesting, but also mind-boggling with its metaphysical nature. ""Have you ever wondered why the Pattern turns, my friend?""


""What?"" The tall Defender of the Stone had his armor reflecting the light of the sun. Hoid did not understand how these men survived the heat while carrying that breastplate. It seemed like stupidity. But, all cultures have their flaws. 


""Why does the Pattern turn and weave you as threads to be born again and again?"" Hoid said to him. ""Have you ever wondered about the potential it has for storytelling...or lack thereof? What is the meaning of a story that is repeated a little hundred times? Is it not repetitive or obnoxious?""


The man frowned, turning to his brown horse. ""You think too much, gleeman.""


""Ah, but what is man without a thought? What is the heart of human being without the need to question its own existence? Most important questions of reality: what is good and what is evil? Does God exist? What is there for us beyond the grave?"" He sighed. ""I suppose you have it easy, my friend - all you have to do is die and you know what awaits. You will be brought back, no! Without a single memory of this, but it still will be you.""


The man looked at Hoid bewildered. ""I...would prefer not to die, thank you.""


""As all would! An unpleasant experience. I have come close to it myself a few times, and I also say I'd rather stay away. Not my cup of tea.""


Hoid played the flute, making deep yet sharp sounds. The Defender, while muttering, did seem to enjoy it. ""How did you learn that? No gleeman I know is as good with flute as you.""


""Quiet, my friend! You will know some of them. My friend Thom is inside the Stone, after all. For someone as young as he is, I'll admit he has great skill. But don't tell him I said that or he will get too high.""


""Thom Merrilin?"" The soldier said. ""Wait...as young? He's at least twenty years older than you.""


""Ah, the appearance might trick you, my friend. That is art on its own - deception. The ability to convince everyone of something that is not true. To convince them you have lived lives you never did or convince them you haven't lived incredibly embarrassing ones. At the end of the day, it is about balance as well, no?""


""Ah."" The man groaned. ""The only art I know is war. That is all I am good at!""


""Of course! Some of us are good at something as small as hearing or seeing. Someone is bad at something you find incredibly easy or passing, while for them something that would be a nightmare to you, such as the solution of mathematics, are as easy as drinking water. Our talents are all varied. It makes no sense to insult one when he doesn't know how to raise a sword or how to write - he knows to do something else you don't.""


The man blinked, staring at Hoid. ""You...you know more than any Aes Sedai, yet you don't look down on me.""


""The only one I look down on, my friend, with exceptions, of course, *are* the Aes Sedai. I would not have a supper with one unless it was a thing of extreme importance."" said the personal advisor of the Amyrlin Seat herself. ""Which, to my regret, is the case in this day and age."" 


Hoid threw dust in the air, making clouds of bright, blue colors that danced like birds in the sky. The soldier stared up at the presentation, his jaw open. ""Wonderful.""


Hoid smiled. He raised his hand and dust run back to his sleeve. ""So, what is your name dear man? I want to know it because of your kindness and hospitality.""


""Remas."" he said. ""But...what kindness? I was just speaking to you.""


""Yes, my good friend."" He patted the man on the shoulder as he passed by him. ""Yes, you did."" He sighed. ""Now...you will have a new lord, won't you? Seems like more work to do.""


The man frowned. ""The Dragon Reborn. We are all doomed. Light help us.""


""Why though?"" Hoid said. ""If the Dragon Reborn is so dangerous, why hasn't he destroyed the world in the previous turnings?""


Hoid felt a bit guilty, seeing Remas had an embarrassed expression on his face, as if he was actually stupid. ""Maybe. But still, some of us shall die."" The man raised his eyebrow. ""I suppose you'll say we will return anyway?""


""Maybe. Maybe not? Alas, we are creatures of ignorance. Tragedy."" And yet he himself was probably the least ignorant human being in all the Cosmos. Remas did not know, but he had a very good reason to fear the Dragon Reborn. Too good a reason. Everyone in existence had it.


""I am afraid I will need to go. I have a few things to settle. I loved our conversation, however.""


""Wait. Hoid...that was your name wasn't it?""


""Among others, yes.""


""Are you a channeler?""


Hoid made a dismissive gesture. ""Goodness, no! That thing is as addictive as alcohol to young men! It looks sweet, then you draw too much of it and you start to feel as if a snake has entered your lungs and is trying to bite its way out. I would never draw it again.""


Remas nodded, mouthing a: ""Yes."" But then the realization of what Hoid had just said hit his face and it went pale. Hoid just shrugged and patted him. ""Farewell! I hope we will see each other again. Send my regards to Lord Dragon. He will know who is Hoid.""


Taking the coin, he played with it while walking through Tear. Filled with people of all backgrounds and lives, he noticed the rulers of it did not do their job properly. Many died in the streets, people without anyone to bury them. Hoid found comfort in the fact that would likely change now that the Dragon has come to Tear. Despite the horrible mistake he made in his very first life, before all the turnings of the Wheel, Hoid knew that at least Rand al'Thor was a good man. Lews Therin was well-intentioned, but ultimately arrogant as well. Tamyrlin was a pragmatist who just happened to be the savior that made the right choices - Maelor and Trystane Adonas were like that as well. Dendry was just a boy, frightened and led by instinct. Rhys Sigurm was a broken, hardened old man, a soldier that almost gave up the fight. Of all of them, Hoid found himself respecting only Rand al'Thor.


Of course, there was the eighth or, rather, the first man as well. *But we don't talk about him.*


The coin almost fell. He grabbed it quickly, holding his breath. He cussed at himself again. He must be more careful. If he does not watch out, Shaidar Haran will find him. That was his only goal in the entire Multiverse, his only direction - to hide from the Hand of the Dark.",1684134370.0

Surge binding - can't use it to soul cast, can't affect with gravitation, probably immune to other surge binding effects

Forging - can't stamp it

Aon Dor - can't write Aeons on it

I believe that aluminum absorbs all or nearly all of the investiture it interacts with (at least in the physical realm) this would explain most of its interactions with invested arts if you assume it absorbs investiture so completely that there is none left to produce the intended effect.

Yet Another Dawnshard Theory,16,13gg9id,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13gg9id/yet_another_dawnshard_theory/,5,"I wanted to take a crack at a Dawnshard theory that isn’t a 4x4 square. Not to say that the Shards cannot be placed as such, but there’s some rough edges that I think prevents clean lines.

The Shards here are presented as 4 aspects associated with each Dawnshard.

“Remake”: Dawnshard of Change held by Rysn

 Ruin, Cultivation, Whimsy, Preservation

Ruin and Preservation are opposites, negative change and the absence of change. Cultivation is positive change. Whimsy is random change. Harmony/Discord is the balancing change. 

“Express”: Dawnshard that Hoid held

Endowment, Invention, Virtuosity, Honor

Invention is creativity, where Virtuosity is skill. Endowment is an indirect way to express yourself where you lack the skill or vision to society. Honor is expressing the bonds you hold.

Why Hoid? In a recent WOB and based on what we know, you need a connection to a Shard in order to hold it. We know Hoid could have held Endowment. Hoid and Endowment might have to be grouped together—and Remake is held by Rsyn and that’s not likely the one Hoid held. This also fits with Hoid’s MO—even Virtuosity seems to share some crossover. 

Why Honor? While it’s hard to place Honor anywhere, I think this arrangement reduces too many Dawnshards from being in one system. I’ve presented Honor as opposite to Endowment, but this isn’t a polar opposite—just a difference in perspective.

“Impassion”: Dawnshard of Emotion

Devotion, Mercy, Valour, Odium

While there’s no as strong as a polarity as Ruin and Preservation, divine Hatred and Love is perhaps the closest. The way Odium is expressed, all of these emotions fall into the same category. In some ways, the opposite of Passion is hatred or the void, which is somewhat funny with Rayse’s attempt to rename himself.

“Master”: Dawnshard of Mastery

Dominion, Ambition, Reason*, Autonomy

Reason is my name for the Wisdom Shard should that exist. Ambition is the willingness for mastery, but Reason is the understanding. This could also toss a bit of a handwave towards why Dominion’s splinters are very ambitious and Autonomy’s push towards exceptionalism seems to skew towards the ambitious. In this, mastery over others (Dominion) is the external variant while mastery over oneself (Autonomy) is the other.

The other Dawnshards (aka the last two) are probably not in the Rosharan system. I could see Zellion holding one (no evidence, though).",1683980900.0

It was confirmed for me when Hoid called him a familiar and indicated he could help locate the Sorceress.

My theory - pattern of Radiant oaths,59,13f7var,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13f7var/my_theory_pattern_of_radiant_oaths/,28,"So, Brandon's said that there's a pattern to the five oaths for all the orders (except maybe Lightweavers?). So I figured I'd put together my theory about what that pattern is.

The TL;DR, here's the pattern I think is there:

First oath: what it means to be Radiant.

Second oath: what it means to be in a particular Radiant order.

Third oath: overcoming your own biases to fulfill the second oath better.

Fourth oath: overcoming the fundamental limitations of the order’s philosophy.

Fifth oath: understand and embody the fundamental principles of the order.



The first oath is easiest - it's the same for all orders. ""Life before Death, strength before weakness, journey before destination."" That's what it is to be a radiant.

The second one is also straightforward - it's just saying what each order is about. Windrunners is ""I will protect"". Bondsmiths is ""I will unite"". Willshapers is ""I will seek freedom for those in bondage"". 

The third oath is trickier - it's not clear how all the radiant orders' third oaths fall under the pattern of ""overcoming your own biases."" But I think they all do. The  Windrunners is most straightforward - ""I will protect even those I hate"" is straightforwardly ""I will fulfill my second oath, even when I really really don't want to"".  For Edgedancers, we see Lift's third oath being ""I will listen to those who have been ignored"".  - but who counts as “ignored” here is who the Edgedancer would usually ignore, not some objective measure. Lift swears this oath when she listens to Nale- he’s a herald and the leader of an order, he’s definitely not “ignored” usually, but he’s exactly the sort of person Lift would usually ignore (an authority figure).  For Skybreakers, this is when they swear to follow an external code - because their own idea of justice is fallible, they need to overcome their own errors.

The Bondsmith one (“when I fail, I will ride again a better man”) is a bit vague, but could also fit the pattern of overcoming your weaknesses.

Fourth oath is when it gets hard because we have very few examples. The Windrunner one is “I will accept that I can’t save everyone”, and the Skybreaker one is the oath of crusade. I think what those two have in common is that they’re about overcoming the fundamental limitations of your order. For Windrunners, how that fits is obvious - the order is all about protecting people, but you can’t protect everyone. For Skybreakers, maybe the ideal of crusade is about how just following the law isn’t enough - it’s a quest where the law alone isn’t serving Justice so the Skybreaker has to fix it. 

Following that pattern, we would expect the fourth oaths of other orders to also be about how sometimes, the fundamental principles of the order just aren’t enough. Maybe the Bondsmith one will be something Dalinar swears after his Bondsmith principles lead him to fail at the contest of champions? 

And the fifth oath, we have only one example - “the Skybreaker becomes the law”. This oath is the one where the Radiant achieves mastery of their order. I think for Kaladin and Windrunners, the remaining issue is squaring the circle of when it’s ok to kill to protect, maybe? I don’t know what Words will be for different orders, but the final result is that the Radiant fully embodies their order’s ideal. 

So there we have it. First oath - what it means to be a Radiant. Second oath - what it means to be in a particular order. Third oath - overcome your weakness. Fourth oath - overcome the issues fundamental to the order. Fifth oath - fully embody the order's principles.",1683858282.0

 I can’t find the wob anymore, but I saw a thread on Splintering and here I’m wondering if Odiums edge could maybe come from the fact that when he splintered other Shards he picked up a bit of that shard, just enough to give him a teeeensy bit more power than the others.

I tried to calculate an energy investiture mass equivalency of a specific thing,39,13eys4j,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13eys4j/i_tried_to_calculate_an_energy_investiture_mass/,16,"Hi, This is my first time posting here, so if I formatted something odd or wrote something weird please correct me.

So a couple of months ago I decided to see if I could calculate the energy mass equivalency for Harmonium, by that I mean what equivalent mass could be made by the investiture in the harmonium.  on a per gram basis. I decided to use the lab explosion because that's the one with the best numbers. Trying to use the battleship explosion at the end of the book doesn't work since we don't know how much harmonium was actually on the ship, even though there is a paper that discusses the ignition of the atmosphere with nuclear weapons. In order to fully calculate everything I made several assumptions. here are most of them.

1: the safe box in wax's lab had aluminum as a coating on the inside and outside rather than part of the actual structural integrity of the box

2: the steel the box was made out of was stainless steel 316 which is used in bank vaults and has a tensile strength of 579 MPa

3: if you build a box and increase the pressure inside of it, it will bend and burst when the pressure reaches the material's tensile strength.

4: the gas in the box heats up uniformly when the harmonium detonates

5: Scadrial is more or less identical to earth

6: The trellium just split the harmonium it didn't react.

I don't know whether or not all my assumptions are correct, so if you have any corrections feel free to share.

Calculations

Since investiture and mass are kind of interchangeable I adjusted Einstein's mass energy equivalency, to be E=(m+b)c\^2 b being the mass equivalent of the investiture in the reaction. To get the pressure in the box I used the ideal gas law (pV=nRT)  assuming earth's atmospheric profile at sea level. A few quick google searches later gives the density of air at sea level (1.2 kg/m\^3) molar mass of air (28.97 g/mol) and the specific heat (1008 J/kgK) from those values and the 27 cubic feet or 0.765 cubic meters  that the box occupies. (R is the gas constant, look it up). From this I calculated the temperature necessary to meet the tensile strength of stainless steel 316, the total temperature is about 1.7 million kelvin. The energy required to raise air from room temperature (293 kelvin) to that 1.7 million kelvin is about 1.555GJ which translates into a mass of 17.283 micrograms. the amount of mass that was in the safe box when the explosion happened was 1/2 a gram. little boy had a 64 kilogram payload and of that payload the energy came from 1/2 a gram of mass turning directly into energy, if we assume that the harmonium trellium detonation in the safe box has that same ratio of 1/128000 then the harmonium would only have lost 3.91 micrograms to energy. The total energy we need is 17.283 micrograms or about 4.42 times the amount in the harmonium so we can assume the investiture provided the other 13.38 micrograms. That means that the ratio of mass to investiture mass equivalent of 3.42.

With this quote of pulling things apart, then rejoining, it made me think of anagrams and if Adonalsium could possibly be one. There is nothing that uses all of the letters but there are a few that use 8/9 of them. One of them is Aluminas, which is described as various forms of Aluminum oxide occurring naturally as corundum. The missing O could be for oxide even.

Let me tell you a bit of my backstory, I am 16M(PS: IF you feel I am immature then please bare with me as I most probably am immature in some things), Two years ago I decided on preparing for JEE Advanced, (one of the hardest if not the hardest entrance exam, all Indian CEOS you know are product of this). I locked myself into a room for 2 years now, 6 months more remain). I worked hard in first 1 and half year and I was way above average but I needed to get much more,\[According to this years cutoffs I need to get a rank of 200 out of 1.4 freaking million aspirants, That's a huge number and I am pretty sure I will get it\]. On 15th September of Last year, I was introduced to Mistborn, It was the first book I was going to read other than selfhelp, after 4 days of reading it, I got very much into it. IT changed my preparation completely, Now I had a reason to study my ass off every single day because the true ecstacy of reading cosmere was when I was tired due to 12-14 hrs. of Studying and then reading for straight 2 hours before sleeping, I was given a gateway to escape from reality into these beautiful worlds with lovely charecters. I had never ever fallen in love with anything like I did with Mr. Sanderson's books. I had read every single book except Stormlight archive by March. Then I read TWOK for the next 1 and half months. And I felt like I was in heaven. ALso before starting cosmere, I used to be anxious all day but now I am very less anxious and more confident than ever, for last 6 months I have hit my society's  gym everyday for an cardio while maintaining 12hrs. of study. I have got a lot more disciplined after reading Dalinar and Kaladin. Then I read the WOR in 2 weeks.

Now here comes the problem, my life was going better than it ever had because of these books but now I am feeling guilty for completing WOR in such a hurry, now everytime I start reading Oathbringer I feel happy but more Anxious. Everyday I wakeup and workhard because I know I will have sanderson novel to read at the end of the day, And just thinking of that day makes me shiver when I come to sleep and I don't have a cosmere book to read, I've never read another book and I don't know If I will feel the same way I do with cosmere. I start to get nauseated and emotional when thinking that only 2 more book remains. I tried to reread mistborn as it was the earliest thing I'd read, I just remember everything that  was going to happen next and It was not fun to read. I need to read books for atleast 4 more months, the last 2 months of my preparation I will only focus on the exam. I've thought of reading 1 ch. per day so it will go till then. Also I nearly have no human interaction other than at gym and while eating with my parents. So these books mean much more to me than many of you can imagine. BS has really helped me make my journey far more better and happier than My destination will ever be and has helped improve my strengths and conquer over some weaknesses and I fear losing of it.

I've meditated enough on it and I think the problem is that in my mind Sanderson in the only person capable of writing such wonderful stories and I've read well over a hundreds of testimonials on it(I am new to epic fantasy world, so I don't know much about other authors). I know it cannot be true but Its hard for me to believe otherwise as so many people write that No one can write as good as BS and no-one is even close, Which I hope is an exaggeration. Here's where I need your help, Can you share your experience. I don't care if the author was in no way similar to BS . I just want to know some experience where the author made you fall in love the World, made you care deeply for characters like the way most feel for Steris or Kaladin. The politics intrigues you, The romantic scenes make you have butterflies. Rivalry which makes the story more interesting. And with great lores if possible. If you've read till here than I will really like to thank you. And any advice you have on anything is welcomed as you can infer I don't really have much life experience .

In the end I will try to remember that

As someone who loves creating characters myself and has been working his way through the Cosmere, I thought it would be fun to use the same list and add some traits for the respective world the character belongs to. The below are the lists of traits from the video, along with lists for Mistborn and Stormlight traits. I'll probably post my results, but I wanted to leave this idea here for anyone else who might be interested, and to see if anyone has ideas for any other traits to add to the lists.

Evil vs good, 
Short vs tall, 
Skinny vs huge, 
Masculine vs feminine, 
Young vs old, 
Introverted vs extroverted, 
Skin color: light vs dark

Mistborn:

Stormlight:

Human (odd) vs listener (even), 
Lighteyes (odd) vs darkeyes (even)

I finished The Lost Metal.,38,13e62w7,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13e62w7/i_finished_the_lost_metal/,10,"I finished The Lost Metal recently.

Wow.  This book was a very satisfying ending to era 2. 
I have always seen era 1 books as movies, whereas the era 2 books kind of seemed like TV shows to me.  
Well, this book was like the series finale of a high-production show on a streaming service.  Top quality.  

I really feel bad that we lost Wayne, but his character played off even death.  He never took ANYTHING seriously that was very serious.  

It was epic that we got to see a lot of crossovers in this book.  I was totally floored to hear about Roshar, Shadesmar, Odium, etc. in a Mistborn book. 
I figured that Codenames was Kaice since she had a seon (from Sel) and understood languages so well.  I figured the brother she mentioned was Adien.
And Moonlight......she made what I would consider nothing less than a shaod stamp to become an Elantrian.  Amazing that she ended up being Shai from Emperor's Soul.  Mind blowing.  

I love it that when you get to the end of things, all the time you have invested in reading these books pays off and ends up being parts of a larger story.
You have not read a bunch of separate stories but different branches in a bigger story.  So satisfying!",1683759282.0
Question about Stormlight Archives,1,13eot5b,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13eot5b/question_about_stormlight_archives/,6," 

I am about to finish the Words of Radiance (sometime today hopefully).

I know that the last book in this Arc ( Knights of Wind and Truth) will be released in about one an a half years.

And I would prefer not finish a book at a cliffhanger that would require me to wait for a significant period of time.

Best case would be for me to go directly from Rhythm of war into Knights of Wind and Truth.

I already read the Ear One Mistborn trilogy, Elantris, and Warbreaker.

My question is, after I finish Words of Radiance, what would you good folks recommend. I think my options are:

\- Keep reading the Stormlight Archines series, and stop after Oathbringer.

\- Start Era 2 of Misborn

\- Pick up a new series. If this is the way, kindly provide recommendations for something similar.

Thank you and have a wonderful day.",1683814852.0

Investiture and access restrictions,6,13e4oyp,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13e4oyp/investiture_and_access_restrictions/,8,"I just finished Tress and while it's a great story, I'm really confused about something - Why can Riina and Hoid use AonDor so far away from Elantris?

So in TLM, Shai, by all appearances, needs the ""purified Dor"" in order to fuel her Forgery (and possibly later her AonDor) since I'm assuming she's off of Sel and she has no access to normal Dor. This left me with the impression that certain Invested Arts only work when in the presence of Investiture with the right Identity and Connection to the user of that Art. This is backed up by Vasher being unable to fuel Awakening with Stormlight. Brandon confirmed that he can stay alive with Stormlight, though, due to certain flaws in his spirit web.

In the case of Riina, I can guess at two things going on. Either she has a reserve of liquid Dor somewhere on her ship that she can readily access (which might explain why she doesn't leave the island) or she got someone to mess with her spirit web so that her Aons can access any Investiture anywhere. For the latter, Vasher's existence on Roshar is proof another Art can access different Investiture, and Forgery can re-write a sprit web (Shai wrote herself into an Elantrian) I'm willing to bet a Bondsmith could re-write a spirit web too. 

But that doesn't explain Hoid. After Riina left, he messes with Charlie's curse to re-write it. Now maybe you don't need Dor to re-write Aon code, and maybe you could hand-wave the whole thing with ""Hoid is just weird."" While true, he is weird, that's an unsatisfying answer and he doesn't give an explanation about his lack of access to Investiture, but does take the time to explain his inexperience with AonDor.

So, am I missing something big here or what's going on?",1683755988.0
Absolutely Everything We Know About Taln's Honorblade,76,13dccc8,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13dccc8/absolutely_everything_we_know_about_talns/,75,"**Spoilers for everything**, all the books, all the other books, even some confirmed ideas not in any book yet. If you are not current on all book sources and outside of book sources beware.

**Timeline**

* Taln's blade is not left with the other nine
   * It is very likely on Braize with Taln(I don't know if this was ever confirmed)
* Taln returns at the end of WOK at Kholinar
   * There we see his honorblade for one line. This is confirmed to be his blade through WOB
      * That's word of Brandon not the secret draft name of book 2 Words of Brandiance
* Taln is moved to the shattered planes via an unknown route, likely via land
* Taln arrives with a shardbladed which is taken off him
   * Amaram claims the shardplade, doesn't gain the power of a Stoneward
   * Dalinar claims it,
      * doesn't gain the power of an Stonward
      * Does here screaming
      * We know from Kaladin holding Jezrien's blade that honorblade don't scream.
* Somewhere along the way Taln's blade was stolen and replaced with a dead shardplade.

**What we are looking for**

1. Someone in the right place
   1. Somewhere in Kholinar, the Shattered planes or inbetween
2. At the right time
3. Who could have known of Taln
4. Who had a motive to make the swap
5. And had access to a dead shardbladed
   1. We assume the same person(s) that took the honorblade are the same person(s) who gave Taln a dead shardblade. Presumably to cover up the theft sneaky style.
   2. Why swap his blade a not just steal his honor blade? I suspect many people heard the story of a mad man with a shardblade, something pretty interesting and rare, but most would not know its an honorblade. Stealing the mad mans blade would be notable and draw attention to your theft. I assume they swapped for another blade so no one would know anything had happened. Minimize the number of people looking into the mad man minimize the number of people who could figure out he had an honorblade and come after you
   3. Shardplades are worth more then some Kingdoms. Each blade is an ancient treasure with a personal history well tracked and recorded. No one recognized the shardblade that Taln's blade was swapped for. So they must have had access to a shard outside of the Alethi/Vorin Historys, one not accounted for or recorded in detail.

**Main Suspects.**

**Taln**

* Is his blade just dismissed? We don't know how honorblades appear when dismissed.
   * Living blades turn back into their Spren form in the physical realm
   * Dead blades reappear in there full bodied form in Shadesmar
   * We've scene the cognitive realm of the tower while Taln was there and the cognitive realm of Thaylen City while Taln was there.
      * Both times he didn't carry a blade. It feels like a literal splinter of honor should have some noticeable impact too people looking into shades mar but nothing is ever mentioned.
* If he does have his blade why did someone give him a shard blade?
* Overall this option is unlikely and just not very fun or cool.
* Taln likely still has his bond to his blade even if he doesn't carry the physical blade and has not summoned it in some time.
   * Why? From what we've scene from the oath pact if the bond between a herald and his blade was broken or stolen(Through hemalurgy or Bondsmithing) Ash, Nale, Kalak or Ishar would have likely mentioned it.
      * Not solid proof i know but worth considering.
      * I feel like there should be a Hermalurgic way to steal a honor blade without alerting the other heralds through the use of coded spikes and Identity but dear god this post is long enough and there just isn't time to even consider that right now.
      * Good idea for a video or post though

**Wit**

* WOB confirmed Wit didn't swap the blade

The Shin

* Have an interest in guarding the blades
* Would likely take a honorblade from Taln if they thought him a simple madman.
* No confirmed Shin aligned character at any of the times or places to make the swap
* Would likely have Shardblades not in the Alethi records

**Sja-Anat**

* Oh yeah this theory is spicy.
* Ishar confirmed that the Shin had ""begun worshiping the unmade""
   * So at some point before ROW an unmade was in Shinovar and had a big impact
* The Shin worship the Spren of natural object (They don't actual worship stone but the spren of the stone) as when Szeth tries to think of an appropriate honorific for Nale-Son-God he can only think of the term they used to honor great Spren
* So if you wanted to corrupt the Shin how would you do it? Corrupt there gods, who corrupts Spren? Sja-Anat
   * This is one theory why Sja-Anat may have been in Shinovar before moving to Kholinar
* If she was there she could have corrupted the Shin Oathgate
   * We know she does corrupt the Kholinar Oathgate.
* So her possible timeline.
   * Before WOK she is in Shinovar corrupts Oathgate.
   * During WOK she moves to Kholinar and corrupts the oathgate, not making her presence known yet
   * End of WOK Taln returns.
   * Assuming the corrupting of the oathgate allow the oathgate to be fuel by voidlight
      * As this is in line with what we know of Awakened/Corrupted Radiance being able to use storm or void light
      * This would mean when fueled by voidlight rather rather then emitting a bright pillar of light when activated it would let of the dark black/violet light of void light.
      * Moving only the control building its possible Sja-Anat agents either spren, awakened radiance or Shin could have stolen blade and moved it away either in person or via oathgate
   * Even if we ignore the oathgate Shin theory Sja-Anat was known to be in Kholinar possibly during WOK and is known to have awakened Spren spy for her every wear, they don't call her taker of secrets for nothing.
   * She very likely would have moved to steal away Taln's blade from Odium if the chance was there.
* The Unmade in Shinovar could very well be the Dustmother, Chemoarish.
   * We here a death rattle "" ""A man stood on a cliffside and watched his homeland fall into dust. The waters surged beneath, so far beneath. And he heard a child crying. They were his own tears.""
   * A common theory is this is Szeth and the dust refers to Chemoarish.
   * They could have both been in Shinovar but I mention this as there are other possibilities for the Unmade in Shin.

**Ashertmarn, the Heart of the Revel**

* Like Sja-Anat known to be in Kholinar
* Not really a sapient spren sop very dumb
* Not subtle
* While Sja-Anat exists half in the phsyical and cognative realm, appearing as a shadow only scene in mirror, the heart appears as as giant mass of meat, so its hard to believing he'd secretly been in LKholinar since book one
* No informants
* no desire to betray Odium

**Yelig-nar**

* Also known to have been in Kholinar
* Should be a sapient spren, confirmed to be able to speak and going by the naming theme of the Unmade should be comparable to Sja-Anat, though unlike Sja the blight wind has no confirmed feats of cunning or intelligence.
* No network of informants
* No motivation to betray odium
* Not likely.

**Nale**

* Network of Skybreakers to inform him
* Can fly with the surge of gravation from his bond and his honorblade
* His Skybreakers actively are looking for signs of surges
* Would take an honorblade from a mad man
* would he take taln's blade from Taln? Doubt it

**Chanarach, Vedel, Pailiah**

* We know functionally nothing about them
* Pailiah was once confirmed to be old ardent in the Palanaeum but recent WOB make that ambiguous
* Chanarach might be the Assassin Liss or Shallan Mother who knows

**Shalash**

* Seemed surprised to learn Taln was returned and in Thaylen city in book 3. She could have been faking her surprise or her maddness clouded it. But all these options feel kinda lame and unsatisfying compared to others. Unlikely she secretly stole Taln's blade.

**Battar**

* Secretly the Ardent Dova working for the Diagram. Possible but unlikely.

**Ishar & Kalak**

* Very likely.
* Kalak leads the sons of honor who would likely still have many agents in Kholnar from back when Gavilar was an important member.
* The sons of honor are specifically interested in the return of heralds so a herald returning would be something they
   * So they could have learned of Taln's reappearance
* Kalak's goal is to escape Roshar, but like all Heralds he is functionally pure investiture coded to Roshar and so cannot leave.
   * Taln's Blade a splitter of honor could be very useful in finding a way to escape.
* Ishar is very close to the shattered planes and Kholinar as he operates out of Tukar
* Kalak is very close aswell operating out of Lasting Integrity which is located in Shadesmar along Tukar's coast placing them very close together.
   * The honorspren of LI are very familir with Kalak so he has likely been there long before the events of ROW.
   * We have scene Kalak in two places in the Modern Era in Kholinar during the assassation of Gavolar and in LI during ROW
* But even if the Sons of Honor learned of Taln how could Kalak move into the physical world in time. he is not confirmed to have a Spren bond or his blade.
   * Both him and Ishar live in Tukar, if in different realms.
   * Both Ishar and Kalak are shown to be on ""good ish"" terms with Nale as both talk with him
      * This means they have a track record of being willing to work with other heralds
      * And have a common ally
   * Ishar is shown to be able to move between realms.
      * As he has been kidnapping Spren for sometime
      * We see him move between realms.
      * He is surprised to see Dalinar open honors path. If Ishar could and had been opening gateways before now why is he shocked? I suspect that before honors death bondsmiths had the power for united the realms in a ""Incomplete perpendicularity"" uniting only physical and cognitive. Making a portal but not one that gives storm light. Therefore when he saw Dalinar unite the realms he was surprised as he did not know this had become possible with the death of honor.
   * We even see Tukary men outside of LI hunting spren. We also know that when Shallan and team arrived at LI Kalak was out and didn't return to LI for many days, putting him well within reach of Tukar and Ishar.
* Kalak is interested in moving investiture off Roshar while Ishar is shown researching bringing invested enities like Spren into the physical realm, so both have a shared interest in a field and could be working together.
* Ishar also plans to slay Odium and Believe himself to be honor reborn. Reclaiming his Taln's blade a shard of honor may be a twisted form of resurrection to Ishar's insane mind. Trying to resemble honor from his splinters.
* Could they have made the swap? Likely

**The Ghostblood.**

* There goal is the move stormlight of Roshar and collect powerful items to defend Scadrial, items like an honorblade.
* They are shown to have power enough to likely have access to an unrecorded dead shardblade.
* Because the Kalak and the Ghostblood have the same goal the ghost blood have been hunting there members for a long time.
   * Shallan is sent after Kalak
   * Her brother is sent against Amaram
* Any where the sons of honor could be and anything they learn(See the Kalak & Ishar section) could be learned by a Ghostblood agent spying on the Sons of Honor.
* No major Ghostblood is known to be Kholinar
* Many are known to be in the shattered planes
* Overall very likely.

Done! Please any mistakes comment below and I will correct the post. I'm looking to have a current and mistake free collection of what we know on the topic.

I am pleased to announce that Kelsier will be running in the upcoming United States presidential election in 2024. In a world where people are losing trust in the government, the rich are gaining more and more power, and justice is found lacking, people want a leader who will set things right. Kelsier is the man for the job. He will put the rich in their places, stand up for the oppressed, and is currently working to transport a clean and renewable energy source. He is the president we need. For more information, go to the website [Kelsier2024.com](https://sites.google.com/view/votekelsier2024). Warning, the website contains spoilers for Mistborn and the Stormlight Archive.

But Kelsier needs YOUR support. You can help by:

* Sharing the campaign. When making a post on any platform about the campaign, use the hastag #Kelsier2024
* Making posts about why Kelsier would be a great president on r/Mistborn and r/Cosmere.
* Posting pro-Kelsier memes on r/cremposting
* Join r/ChurchoftheSurvivor

There is more to come from this campaign, including poles pitting Kelsier against other Cosmere characters, which Kelsier is going to win. And remember, there is always another secret, but it's no secret that you should vote for Kelsier!

^(If you are unsure, this campaign is just for fun. It is in no way serious. Thanks for reading.)",1683601165.0

How important is Secret History to The Lost Metal?,25,13crbja,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13crbja/how_important_is_secret_history_to_the_lost_metal/,36,"I have read just about every book in the Cosmere except The Lost Metal, and when I read Arcanum Unbounded I skipped Hope of Elantris and Secret History.

"Announcement: Spoiler Policy Updates concerning Lost Metal, Tress, and future Secret Projects",313,13c5d89,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13c5d89/announcement_spoiler_policy_updates_concerning/,15,"Just a quick update here on some related things we wanted to alert people about!

# 1. Retiring ""No TLM"" flair options

May 15th will mark the 6-month anniversary of The Lost Metal, and we figure we're past due on removing the default `Mistborn (no TLM)` and `Cosmere (no TLM)` flair options. As always, *flair text is editable*, so if you haven't read a book (like TLM) you are welcome to add something like that on to any of the defaults.

# 2. Tress spoilers folded into Cosmere tags

Historically, we have allowed new books to be discussed under Cosmere tags immediately at publication. Between the tight turnaround from TLM to Tress, the lack of a single release date, the limited availability, and the unusual nature of the Secret Projects, we felt that Tress needed to be handled differently than usual. Instead of folding it into Cosmere immediately, we have *excluded it.* If you want to talk about Tress with other Cosmere spoilers, you've had to use the `Cosmere + Tress` tag.

We originally announced that this would persist for 3 months after release. With the delays on fulfillment of hardbacks, we decided to hold off when the 3 month mark came. And now we've decided the time has come.

**Starting May 15th, full Tress spoilers are permitted under general Cosmere tags.**

# 3. Plans for Secret Projects 3 and 4 (and beyond)

Based on the survey we recently conducted, the way we handled Tress *differently* was a bit confusing for people. But we do feel there was some merit to the decision, and many people feel like the Tress strategy should be *the norm*.

We've debated the pros and cons of each... And we've decided, picking one or the other is needlessly complicated. :) Our plans for future releases is to ask people to be explicit *either way,* for a period of time.

So here's what's going to happen. When Secret Project 3 releases, we will change the default Cosmere flair to read `Cosmere (+SP3)` and we will *also* add a `Cosmere (no SP3)` option. This way the policy of any given thread or comment is clear to everyone without having to know what our general policy is. In the case of Secret Project 3, we will do this for three months before making an announcement and folding SP3 into general Cosmere tags (as we're doing on May 15th with Tress).

Of course, in this case that will coincide with the release of Secret Project 4. So at that point you'll see `Cosmere (+SP4)` and `Cosmere (no SP4)` options. If that all goes well, we expect to apply the same strategy to all other future releases.

# More coming...

Keep us updated with your opinions on how that goes, when the time comes. And in the meantime let us know if you have any questions.

**Also, please keep an eye out for our annual survey,** **which should be up by June 1st!** The community's input on that survey directly feeds into our rules and policies.

"Theory: Death (spoilers for mistborn, secret history, stormlight, shadows for silence)",31,13c59vh,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13c59vh/theory_death_spoilers_for_mistborn_secret_history/,29,"Hello all. This post contains spoilers for the several works listed in the title and for Cosmere in general.    
  
First things first: we know Adonalsium was shattered. The reasons why are unknown. I suspect not all involved parties participated out of greed or lust for power, but that’s not directly relevant here.   
  
In mistborn secret history, Kelsier notices that “metal and souls are the same thing.” When metal is burned by an allomancer - at least this is true for god metals like atium - it slowly returns to the world in the form of condensed investiture, e.g., the well of power. But when a person dies, their soul goes does not return to the world but instead goes “beyond.”   
  
I believe that souls, as a kind of investiture, go “beyond” as another form of congealing or condensation. As souls exist throughout Cosmere, assuming all souls go “beyond” following death, this is more general than any one particular form of investiture associated with specific shards.   
  
I posit for discussion that the souls that go beyond are becoming congealed to reform Adonalsium.  
  
Adonalsium would then be “the god beyond” worshipped in Threnody and elsewhere. He is literally “beyond”, as the “somewhere else” that souls - the same thing as metal, that is, investiture- go when they die.   
    
This corresponds to the cobbler’s religion in stormlight, according to which “the one” split itself so it could experience itself - we are all part of the one, and will become one again.   
   
But to become one would require the death of all living souls. This would explain the recreance: surgebinding is a power capable of destroying worlds, and thus returning power to Adonalsium. This would explain the beliefs and efforts of the seventeenth shard, who believe Adonalsium was split for a reason. Presumably, they would be against reunification.     
  
I think Adonalsium is either THE big bad, or at the least only comes into play with the destruction of the entire cosmere (which makes narrative sense as the ultimate stakes).",1683580943.0
An idea I had for coin shots,43,13c1hwo,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13c1hwo/an_idea_i_had_for_coin_shots/,49,"A coin shot could have a pair of shoes with small pieces of metal in the soles of the shoes so that they can always take off, even if they don’t have any metal sources nearby.
They would have to be custom made so that when the metal is shot out it doesn’t break the shoe, but this could be really useful. You could also surround the sides and bottom of the pellets with aluminum, but not the top because then the coin shot couldn’t see them. When used, the pellets would rip through the aluminum on the bottom.

I would love to see this used in Mistborn era 3",1683572904.0

Mistborn THoA / WoK Deaths,5,13cf767,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13cf767/mistborn_thoa_wok_deaths/,2,"Hi, wondering which planet experienced more casualties during specific periods of time- to get a better idea of the destruction of both scenarios.
Mistborn- The Hero of Ages ending when 97% of all life on Scadrial dies in the remaking of the world.
The Way of Kings- All Desolations (excluding False Desolation and deaths AFTER Everstorm).
The deaths that count are unnatural deaths such as those through combat through each (excluding False Desolation) Desolation and the combat deaths of all plateau runs before the Everstorm on the Shattered Plains. Mistborn deaths includes the 97% biolossage between when Vin melted half the planet and Sazed remade the world protecting solely those in the few caverns around the planets Norther Hemisphere, and the masked ones on the south pole.
Which planet received more deaths after each side is totaled up? For Mistborn, remember there is a ridiculous number of Skaa on the planet, which is why I'm asking if the Mistborn events led to more deaths than that of the events highlighted in TWoK.
Sorry for the confusing... Guidelines?- to the question? I tried to be a specific as possible, but if people complain in the comments about further confusion, I'll make a formula for you. It's late and I don't have the brain power to figure this one out on my own. Good luck, and please let me know if you do need anything clarified. Thank you!

Travels of Hoid - Cosmere/Wheel of Time Crossover,8,13bg571,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13bg571/travels_of_hoid_cosmerewheel_of_time_crossover/,6,"A score of folk had gathered on the Green since the gleeman appeared from the inn, young men and women down to children who peeked, wide-eyed and
silent, from behind the older onlookers. All looked as if they were waiting for miraculous things from the gleeman. The white-haired man looked them over - he appeared to be counting them - then gave a slight shake of his head and sighed.

""I suppose I had better give you a small sample. So you can run tell the others. Eh? Just a taste of what you’ll see tomorrow at your festival.”

He took a step back, and suddenly leaped into the air, twisting and somersaulting to land facing them atop the old stone foundation. More than
that, three balls - red, white, and black -began dancing between his hands even as he landed.
A soft sound came from the watchers, half astonishment, half satisfaction. Even Rand forgot his irritation. He flashed Egwene a grin and got a delighted one in return, then both turned to stare unabashedly at the gleeman.

""You want stories?” Thom Merrilin declaimed. “I have stories, and I will give them to you. I will make them come alive before your eyes.” A blue ball
joined the others from somewhere, then a green one, and a yellow. ""Tales of great wars and great heroes, for the men and boys. For the women and girls,
the entire Aptarigine Cycle. Tales of Artur Paendrag Tanreall, Artur Hawkwing, Artur the High King, who once ruled all the lands from the Aiel Waste to the Aryth Ocean, and even beyond. Wondrous stories of strange people and strange lands, of the Green Man, of Warders and Trollocs, of Ogier and Aiel. The Thousand Tales of Anla, the Wise Counselor. ‘Jaem the Giant-Slayer.’ How Susa Tamed Jain Farstrider. ‘Mara and the Three Foolish Kings.’ ”

""Tell us about Lenn,” Egwene called. “How he flew to the moon in the belly of an eagle made of fire. Tell about his daughter Salya walking among
the stars.”

Rand looked at her out of the corner of his eye, but she seemed intent on the gleeman. She had never liked stories about adventures and long journeys. Her favorites were always the funny ones, or stories about women outwitting people who were supposed to be smarter than everyone else. He was sure she had asked for tales about Lenn and Salya to put a burr under his shirt. Surely she could see the world outside was no place for Two Rivers folk. Listening
to tales of adventures, even dreaming about them, was one thing; having them take place around you would be something else again.

""Old stories, those,” Thom Merrilin said, and abruptly he was juggling three colored balls with each hand. ""Stories from the Age before the Age of
Legends, some say. Perhaps even older. But I have all stories, mind you now, of Ages that were and will be. Ages when men ruled the heavens and the
stars, and Ages when man roamed as brother to the animals. Ages of wonder, and Ages of horror. Ages ended by fire raining from the skies, and Ages
doomed by snow and ice covering land and sea. I have all stories, and I will tell all stories. Tales of Mosk the Giant, with his Lance of fire that could reach around the world, and his wars with Elsbet, the Queen of All. Tales of Materese the Healer, Mother of the Wondrous Ind.”

""Boring."" A voice called out. ""This lovely hears such tales every year. Is it really true you haven't thought of something new by all those yours?""

Thom Merrilin groaned, not even wanting to look at the owner of the voice. Egwene and Perrin both sighed, but Rand and Mat chuckled. The man that the entire Two Rivers knew very well, was dressed in a simple black coat, matching his raven-black hair. He would usually appear out of nowhere, then disappear. 

""What do you want now?"" Merrilin said. 

""Apparently, saving you from embarrassment, my friend. It is a hard thing to do when you are making yourself as noticeable as you are.""

""Light burn you, Hoid!"" Merrilin waved away. ""You're ten times worse than a fly that follows a horse!""

Hoid placed a hand on his chest. ""Me? Dear Thom, thank you! I would have never expected a comparison between me and such a delightful creature like a fly. I have to save you from embarrassment now, please!""

""Me! What do you have,"" Thom threw three more balls in the air, catching each of them. ""to outdo this!""

""You did not just ask me that."" Hoid walked close to the gleeman, standing just a bit taller than he. ""Now, move just a bit."" He smiled at the crowd with his keen blue eyes. Those eyes were able to sometimes fill Rand with unease, not to mention that most of the time it seemed Hoid was looking right at him. He took out his long, black flute. ""You want stories, ladies and gentlemen? I will give you a story I heard long ago, on a world where storms last forever, and the gods die. A world where the wind has voices and death has children.""

Thom scoffed. ""Oh, yes. Another one of you 'worldhooping' journeys, isn't it?""

""One in a thousand, my friend. Though that one was more formal. But it's the best place for stories.""

""You cannot be serious?"" Thom Merrilin complained. ""Your stories have absolutely no basis in reality! They have no truth behind them?""

""What truth? Historical truth or poetic truth? Because I find the latter much more important.""

Thom scoffed again.

""Well, let's see how you will appreciate true art."" The audience all went silent while Hoid sat down, holding it sideways to his mouth. And then, he played it. The melody was soothing like warm water, so lovely no one dared as much as cough while it played. Egwene leaned on Rand, her head resting on his shoulder. Even Thom was moving his body in a way that made it obvious he enjoyed the music, to his own shock. And all of a sudden, Hoid raised his hands, throwing smoke into the air. But instead of falling on the others, smoke danced in the air following his music. 

""This is the story,"" he said, the music still echoing through the flute. ""of Nianel and her little sister, Miather.""

The smoke gathered into a shape that resembled an old house on a hill. ""Nianel was the elder, the most beautiful and hard-working woman of the country. Thousands and thousand of men would have gladly had her for their bride, while women would have all made her their sister if they could."" 

As the smoke swirled, Rand could see a perfect face of a woman. In a moment it was as real and clear as the faces before him, only to vanish. Hoid's notes did not stop playing. ""Miather was just a child. Playful, joyful and full of life. As far as Nianel was concerned, she did not need anyone except her sister in life. And to Miather, she was like a queen.""

And what does a queen look like? Rand thought of Moiraine Sedai. 

""One day, a storm came to their house."" The smoke changed again, turning into a huge cloud, that was rumbling with thunders. Several people in the audience flinched, taking the sound to be too real. Hoid smiled at that, while Thom's face remained stern. ""And that happened while Miather was playing outside with a fox.""

The tune became...uneasy, having a sense of dread that crawled under Rand's skin. His heart started beating faster. ""During the very storm, Nianel went outside, calling her sister to come home. 'Mia, Mia, come back to me. Come back to me!' she continued screaming all the while the storm was there."" The figure in the cloud ran through it like a thunder travelling through the storm. ""She turned up every rock, cut down every tree, questioned every beast of air, field or water, but Miather was nowhere to be found.""

The image changed now and had the shape of a woman with her face in her hands, sobbing. ""As you could imagine, the sisterly bond made everything stronger. Stronger love, stronger grief. The very tumult of the sea is unable to stand against the grief of a sister.

Nianel wondered: 'What did I do wrong? How could have I stopped it? Oh, when will I hear your soft voice again?'"" Rand gazed at him. Hoid's voice changed - it was not that of a man anymore. ""She continued: 'When will we ever play in the grass? When will we ever hold our hands? Never! Never will I know you again, and never will there be end to my pain.'""

Rand heard a few sighs behind himself, and he saw Egwene's eyes had tears in them. Even Mat's face was now down, as he cleaned his nose and tried to look away. The smoke changed again, showing a woman standing above a cliff.

""Nianel thought: 'Nothing will ever heal my pain, for I will never know you again.' So she came to the Cliff of Life, where she wanted to end it all. She did not look back, letting the cold wind touch her body. And she wept."" Water started falling from the crowd. ""Wept with the rain. She looked up and said only one thing: 'Why?' before she raised her foot to make a step.

And then,"" Hoid threw something else into the air, a golden dust that broke the gloomy image, dancing in the air above them all. The figure of a grown woman hugged the light. ""'Why did you get here?' asked the little girl."" Hoid's voice changed again. ""'I thought I lost you forever?'

'Why? You cannot lose me, you know me.'

'Where were you?'

'I was playing here.' And Miareth took up her doll and put it into Nianel's hands. 'Let's play together.'

'We...will play together always, Mia?'

'As long as we love one another.' said the little girl. 'Always. I love you.'""

The smoke disappeared. Rand closed his eyes to make sure he still had them - the bliss was so bright it blinded him for a second. Aside from a few women and children allowing a tear to fall, Egwene among them, silence was the chief here. With a sly smile, Hoid looked at Thom, who looked like he was about to start shaking himself. The gleeman cursed. ""Light burn you, you fool!"" He chuckled, with a soft voice and started clapping. ""May the Creator himself burn you!""

A thunderous applause followed, filling the usually quiet night with great appreciation for art. Hoid bowed before everyone. ""Thank you, thank you, ladies and gentlemen!"" The smoke returned to him, racing up his sleeve and its light disappearing. 

""Please accept this!"" Master Luhhan offered some money. ""Please, this was wonderful!""

""Oh, no, no!"" Hoid said. ""The storytelling itself is the true reward to me. Stories make the world go round."" He shrugged. ""Or worlds, I guess.""

The entire crowd echoed with laughter, even Thom joining them. It all ended, though, when someone arrived. ""Why is there a gathering here?""

Rand and Egwene both stood up at the sound of that voice. Frowning as she ever did, she made everyone either mutter, like Thom, or bow their heads in respect, like Egwene. She did not give anyone any consideration, only passingly looking at them. She made an obvious frown at Rand and the others, but the true cause of her arrival was standing right before the inn.

""You are not a very welcome person here, Hoid."" the Wisdom said, while Rand was holding his breath. The gleeman really thought he will outsmart Nynaeve of all people. Though people seemed to like Hoid and his tricks, there were many rumors. Some said he was just that - a trickster.

WoK and WoR - my thoughts and predictions (so far),34,13b5wu7,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13b5wu7/wok_and_wor_my_thoughts_and_predictions_so_far/,13,"**I've finished Way of Kings and I'm part way through Words of Radiance** (just finished part 2 and now >!Shallan has arrived at the shattered plains).!<

Just wanted to share my thoughts after lurking on this sub forever:

\- This world is huge isn't it. I'm about 40% through WoR and I'm already thinking about having to re-read the whole series again once I finish it. I love how packed full of detail it is though. It feels like my enjoyment of the series as a reader is dependant on how much I'm willing to learn and remember - super rewarding to those who really immerse themselves in the world.

\- So far I prefer WoK. Now that may obviously change as I'm yet to finish WoR, but it feels like a bit more of a slog in parts compared to the first book. For example, >!Shallans journey to the shattered plains on the wagon!< wasn't interesting to me. Only towards the end did it get a bit spicy. On the other hand I know once this inevitable sanderlanche hits I'll change my mind on this no doubt.

\- I hear a lot about people finding Shallan's chapters boring but so far I think they're the most interesting. Through her we get to see more of the world outside the shattered plains, and her growth as a character really appeals to me. Loved Kharbranth as a city too. The chapters with her and Jasnah were really funny.

**Predictions for the rest of the books (I'm way off with a lot of these I'm sure)**

\- I can't wait for Adolin and Sadeas to inevitably duel. I think Sadeas will have the better of Adolin and then Kaladin/Renarin will step in to save Adolin? Maybe that's a bit corny but I feel like Adolin is being built up to be indestructible within duelling. Somehow I think he will have a failure in there somewhere!

\- Better yet, I think Dalinar and Sadeas would make more sense in a duel?

\- Hot take, I don't think Jasnah is dead. Maybe I'm just coping, but no way is she dead. Her character has so much left to give and I think she'll be out there somewhere. Maybe she's in Shadesmar?

\- Renarin is way too much of a bit-part character right now, I think he has a huge transformation coming at some point and will come into his own",1683500350.0

It makes sense to me that that’s when Isaac and Dan will release their stories, in that three-five year window, alongside maybe a revision of White Sand Prime.

Do you guys agree? Which stories will they write do you think? 

My guess is that Isaac does his Nicelle story, maybe Nazh or something on Darkside (Taldain).

I think Dan will do his Dark One and maybe something with Mythos. Maybe also something on Threnody.

Dawnshard Speculation,33,13a9r41,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/13a9r41/dawnshard_speculation/,39,"So, we know that Hoid had a Dawnshard at some point in the past (presumably before the shattering due to some information from Dragonsteel Prime, but this is not canon). We also know that Hoid + at least 16 others were present at the shattering, and that they used the Dawnshards to shatter Adonalsium.

So, in trying to wonder where the Dawnshards are now, I wanted to try and think through what happened to them after the Shattering.

The way I see it, there are a few possibilities.

1. Hoid left with all 4 dawnshards. This doesn't seem super likely to me, but is possible.
2. Other people present that did not pick up Shards had some of them. I'll get to why I dislike this theory in a second.
3. They just left them laying around.
4. Some of those that took up Shards, also had Dawnshards.

My biggest problems with 1-3 are that the new Shards would be highly aware of the power of these weapons, given what they had just been used for... and it seems they would be unlikely to just leave them in the hands of others to possibly used against them.

Option 4 is perhaps the most interesting from a theorizing perspective, because it would give some credence to certain ALL CAPs words that are associated with shards that we have seen before, for example: SURVIVE (preservation) or DESTROY (endowment).

But given all of that, what do you think is most likely to have happened to the Dawnshards after the shattering? Where do you think the ones other than Change are now?",1683425787.0

SA5 Prologue: SPOILER is definitely not who they say they are,98,139slva,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/139slva/sa5_prologue_spoiler_is_definitely_not_who_they/,79,"So I know this has already been widely discussed, but the ""Stormfather"" we see talking with Gavilar in the SA5 prologue is almost certainly not the real Stormfather. In the prologue there is this line:

**Then, the Stormfather cried out. A sound like a peal of thunder, agonized.**

**“What?” Gavilar said, backing up. “What happened?”**

***A Herald… A Herald has died… No. I am not ready… The Oathpact… No. They mustn’t see. They mustn’t know…***

**“Died?” Gavilar said. “Died. You said they were already dead! You said they were in Damnation, being tortured!”**

Im currently rereading Oathbringer, and in Chapter 38 when Dalinar brings Jasnah and Navani into the vision of the Aharietiam, when the Stormfather tells them about what happened to the heralds and the Oathpact, he says:

**He (Taln) finally broke. He has joined the Nine who still live. In these millennia none have ever died and returned to Damnation.**

So either the two ""stormfathers"" are one and the same and he is SUPER devious (which would probably go against oaths which he cannot break?) or the being we see with Gavilar is something different entirely, because it is aware that a herald has died whereas the Stormfather bonded to Dalinar is unaware that any other heralds have died and thinks Taln broke - which we know he didn't.

&#x200B;

Personally, I think it's super exciting that the stormfather is so blind to what is happening in the world - I think the theory about Shallan's mother being a herald and being the one to break is correct, so the Stormfather's idea of what's happening is totally off.

&#x200B;

^(Sorry if this has been discussed already or seems super obvious, it's the first real ""evidence"" of a theory I've found on my own in a reread which Im super stoked about, I usually just listen to what other people found.)",1683386112.0

I support this theory further by noticing that Kaladin has a “worldsinger” in bridge four from day 1 (sigzil). Preservation could after all have thought another 3-500 years down the line.

Answer: No. 

The Fused are like Radiant and radiant spren in one and while restricted to an internal focus, it is presented as Fused having effectively limitless access to investiture to use the Surges (still in an internal way).

Perhaps you can’t use Breath to provide you with perpetual investiture for your personal use (Maybe you can, but that’s another theory.) However, Breath can be used to Awaken—which often is in the form of kinetic energy.

While I can't link to a specific comment (probably because I didn't back it; I found out about it later and ordered via their site... and then learned of all of the issues), there's one comment and reply I find of particular note (I believe it's the first one posted on this update):

>Tyrone Pollard BACKER

>You know what would be even better? (Beyond the obvious of having the actual deluxe slipcase edition). If all of the backers of those editions were provided free digital copies. I understand that isn’t free for you, but I feel like there has to be a significant mark up and so I can’t imagine it would cost you close to (2003+1000)\*$40 ≈ $120k. Surely you have some marketing budget that could be used, because this is doubtlessly damaging your brand and such an action would surely be seen as a positive step. But I don’t think it’s really fair to be asking for more money from people who have already paid 85usd + shipping and have been waiting for over a year. I get that a lot of this has been your own fault, but expecting your customers to cough up more money for what isn’t even a proper solution isn’t a fun place to be.

We do not expect people to go for this if they do not wish to. We were asked to, and it was permitted. This actually underscores that there is no action that we can do outside of working on delivering the books as anything we try may make some fans happy, we will inevitably upset more.

&#x200B;

My personal opinion here (and again, I'm not a backer so this probably wouldn't apply to me unless they added this option for pre-sales of the Deluxe Slipcase Edition) is that Tyrone is right. Given how long this has taken and how many issues have come up, it seems reasonable to me that Dynamite should eat the cost of digital copies for backers of the Deluxe Slipcase Edition. But, only for the Deluxe Slipcase edition (signed or unsigned). This includes refunding those who added on a copy of the digital version. To ""save money"", they can require/request that those who paid for the digital copy to reach out for a refund rather than making it automatic. I think that Nick's insistence that they would also have to do this for Trade Paperback and / or regular Hardcover editions is wrong as those backers/purchasers received their product(s) quite some time ago. The digital copies would be an apology to all of those who have not yet received their slipcase editions. 

If memory serves, Dragonsteel gave free digital copies of the Secret Project books to backers because of those delays and that was only a matter of a few months, not a year. I can't see them telling Dynamite they can't do the same, even if Dynamite would still be paying the royalties to Dragonsteel / Brandon Sanderson. I think it's just the cost of doing business when you're having so many issues.

Couple of comments:
Elantris is really his most poorly developed and written. The dialogue is stilted. The character’s motivation and decisions are stilted. The plot jumps along suddenly. However, I loved the magic system. I loved the characters themselves. And I loved the mystery. You get glimpses of what he will become, but they’re not all there yet.

All of his stories seem to follow the same basic formula, so it’s pretty easy to see where he’s going with the plot. I guessed several major plot twists simply because he follows the same template. That’s not to say he didn’t leave me wondering, but I was not as flabbergasted by some of the plot twists as I think I was supposed to be.

I LOVE his magic systems. I love how connected they are by underlying theory. I love the little character appearances that you have to leap to realize. 

All in all-Stormlight is my favorite with Mistborn being a close, close second.

But nothing, absolutely nothing can compete with Wayne. He’s probably my second favorite character in any fantasy novel I’ve ever read. What with his humor, love of hats, and creating the biggest damn explosion ever.",1683158848.0

2. Connected to question 1, if Riina can do lightweaving, does that mean she is in fact a Lightweaver? Or does the term lightweaving in the cosmere just mean making illusions, and she made the illusion using aon magic?
3. How the Braize did Cephandrius make an aon shield without being able to use aon magic yet? I was so mad when he said he wouldn't ""bore us with the mechanics"". My only guess is that he used Lightweaving and somehow invested it...

Edit: (q3) so I looked back at my book, and when Hoid makes the light shield to save Tress, he says it was made of aons “which i could now draw”. When I read it, I thought it said “which I could NOT draw”, so I thought he technically wasn’t an elantrian yet when he made the shield, but became one shortly afterwards.

The chapter sprouts are Crow's ""curse"". More we fond about her, more it grew. So mu guess is either it will sprout more into a ""skull"", or she will be cured and it will start to dissapear.

**The story itself**

Characters

I think I really liked the way the archs ended for all of the characters, except maybe Marasi. It was definetely Wayne’s best book, as I think we finally saw the depth in him that I think was always there and just didn’t really coem off through the pages, and it really puts into perspective everything else he did, I think rereading the story I would appreciate him a lot more. My only gripe with Wayne is a thing that Sanderson does rather often, which is that characters have a very spelled out realization and are extremely self-aware in that sense. When Wax asks him about it, he knows he wants forgiveness, that he’s struggling with his sense of self-worth, etc., etc. I think this type of thought process works for some characters like Wax and especially in Stormlight like Jasnah and Rysn. But this type of self-awareness is extremely rare irl, and the fact that all of Sanderson’s characters have it make me feel the author’s presence a lot more than I’d like. especially for a character like Wayne, that is supposed to not be self-aware. I still really enjoyed the arch despite this though.

Wax’s arch also felt unique enough because it feels like in the previous books he had to come to terms with the fact that he wasn’t only a lawman, and in this one it was the whole thing that you can be more than one thing at once, which was also complemented by the fact that he’s now spiked.

Steris really  shined here, cause I don’t feel like we actually got a proper arch for her before, it was more like she was learning to appreciate things outside her rigidity and accept the more unpredictable aspects of life. And it’s like she was valuing this so much at this point (things that other people were better at than she) that she forgot the value in her unique characteristics in the first place, which is what she has to learn in this book. Loved that for her.

Marasi’s thing in BoM with realising she didn’t want to be the type of hero Wax was, that it wasn’t for her, was really cool. And here, her realising that the Ghostbloods also weren’t for her, because she liked working more in the open, was also cool. But her conclusion being becoming governor was really underwhelming tbh.

Mistborn plot things

I personally felt like this was a bit weaker than what is standard for Sanderson, it’s hard to pinpoint why. I guess the fact that we knew  the threat of the bomb from the start and then that  ended up being exactly what it was. I also felt like the whole other-world soldiers was a bit too much of a left-turn from the way  the story was going, and there wasn’t enough set up to really believe or care in these super-high stakes things. It’s kind of funny that what I liked about Era 2 was mostly the plot and the delving deeper into the magic system of Mistborn with technology and stuff, which was sort of left behind in this one. But then I liked the character archs more than  usual and I think they really augmented what we got from the previous books and were wrapped in a nice way, as opposed to the plot.

Heard this theory that Alik drained the bands, which I am now really invested in.He seems a little too nice to be true… I think there’s a moment in the book where they are talking about the Bands and he does defend that they belong to the Malwish. Also the Ghostbloods seem to think he’s relevant as well.

Sazed’s disconnect is creeping me out a little bit. I don’t know if I like the idea that Ruin is stronger than Preservation in a way that Harmony will eventually lead to Discord. I guess we’ll have to see what Sanderson does with it in the future. I mean, Adonalsium was a whole being, and it seems like he was doing fine before he was shattered. Why couldn’t his powers be together? They were originally together after all… I guess this idea that the Shard’s powers repel each other is also supported by the whole trellium-harmonium thing. But if they were originally one thing, I don’t understand why they would repel each other so mcun (especially when held by the same avatar). And this seems to contradict what happens in other storeis as well! The powers of Aona and Skai melded together in the Dor, didn’t they? And so did Honor and Cultivation’s, to form Shardbearer’s powers (to my understanding). I’m sure Sanderson has an explanation for this, but it does make me wonder…

**Cosmere things**

So many name drops of new worlds I can’t even keep up hahah

Shai’s stamps- Is there an explanation as to why this stamp made her forget everything? Because from what we saw in Emperor’s Soul she could change herself without forgetting everything, even learning insane fighting skills.

Really curious to know about what MeLaan is up to with those red haired people.

Loved seeing Kaise (is that how it’s spelled?). I loved her in Elantris so much. THe fact that hse grows up to be a Ghostblood makes a lot of sense. The whole timeline of things is confusing me a bit though. How much time is Elantris and Emperor’s Soul supposed to be before Era 2? What makes WorldHoppers not age properly? I know there’s gotta be an explanation but—

OMG the Ghostbloods being led by Kelsier! Was not expecting that… (I haven’t read RoW so maybe all the answers to the questions I have will be there lol). But wow. It always felt to me like they were a bit evil. I also don’t understand what they’re doing, so invested in Roshar, if their main goal is to protect Scadrial. What could they possibly want Jasnah dead for ?

Is TwinSoul from Yolen? Is that the world he can’t come back to ?

My biggest theory is that Hoid is only a device, or you could say vessel, to set up the biggest cosmere threat yet, Kelsier. At some point in era 3 Kelsier will be searching for a way to bring back his Mistborn powers. I think this leads him to a Fortune ferring who he then spikes, using his newfound fortune to track down the ever elusive, fortune abusing HOID. He will then spike Hoid become the most powerful non shard in the cosmere, maybe even more powerful with combined investigure.

Every living being in the cosmere has some amount of investiture in them. And we know that investiture is the magic of the cosmere. We also know that sorcerers innately have magic.

Most of the powers in the cosmere are gained by either being chosen, meeting criteria, or bonding with something. This means these powers are gained from an outside force, mostly one that doesn't know you are pulling that power. And as we know that is a typical description of a warlock (Or Paladin/cleric depending on flavor).

Do any of you have opinions on this?

I'm up to Chapter 25 of Words Of Radiance, and, no spoilers please, but I saw a while ago a video with Brandon Sanderson where he was asked to describe Moash using nothing but positive descriptors, and he couldn't do it. Youtube videos under it say things like ""Moash: Rhythm Of War"" and Moash: Deadeyes, the former clearly being book 4 and the latter being a title for an event I'm yet unaware of. Theres a video with the thumbnail ""Storm Moash"" and I understand thats basically F*** Moash, but I don't know why. And then a video titled: ""Moash, did he do anything wrong?"" 

And I'm like ... I'm enjoying the experience of knowing he clearly does SOMETHING, but ever since Brando Sando's comment I feel like I've subconsciously read into every line by Moash as if I'm going to catch him out on a lie or some foreboding foreshadowing, and so far ... he seems fine. Whats going to happen? I don't want to know, I'll find out in time, but it's like reading Donna from Doctor zwho in reverse, where I initially disliked her and everyone kept insisting ""no shes the best"". I have this absolute sense of dread every time Moash shows up, but purely out of metatextual ... what appears to be absolute loathing from the fans. If not for accidentally seeing hints outsidr of it, I'd have no idea to even look for it, but I'm enjoying being in the dark and having this third party ""he bad"" despite the text giving no impressions of the sort. It builds anticipation but only on a meta level.

Crystalline structure and investiture,35,134mwwp,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/134mwwp/crystalline_structure_and_investiture/,10,"I was reading through a post this morning about Allomancy and how the metals are not the investiture themselves but act as a key to accessing Preservation’s investiture.  This made me think about metals and how they might compare to the ways other materials interact with investiture.

On Roshar- stormlight(investiture) is able to be stored within gemstones due to their crystal lattice structure. Metals are also crystalline in structure, I think it’s just a much tighter lattice, and with fabrials we know metals can be used to alter the way the investiture works for a particular function.

Maybe the investiture moves along the lattice structure similar to electricity moving through a conductor? With a gemstone, the looser structure doesn’t allow it to “flow” into any particular purpose and is just trapped inside—with metals the investiture moves along the crystalline structure and is directed towards a purpose related to that metals structure. 

With allomancy—as the metal is metabolized the metal in the body allows the allomancer to direct the flow of investiture through themselves. Like a fabrial. 

This might’ve been obvious to most of you but it clicked for me today—and that’s as far as my rudimentary chemistry can take me with this haha

We know from plenty of experiences around the cosmere that aluminium is an investiture drain. However, when using aluminium as a Mistborn (or if you‘re a leecher applying your power to sb else).

However, strictly speaking, the effect should be draining the *ability* to use metals (if that’s where the investiture comes in). If these can drain *metals*, that would imply to me that the metals themselves are invested. As a consequence, allomancers would have to rely on Scadrian metals only.

One magic system has felt completely OP and is rarely mentioned as being too strong in the cosmere -  Feruchemy.

The ability to draw upon, at will, upon a collective unconscious is strong - not unlike the internet but more intense as you have proper scholars preparing the material. Yet, Ruin could influence the metal minds of a feruchemist.

Idk what I wantd to say. I've read almost all the cosmere, the fourth ideal of the wind runners is broken, soul magic as seen in the emperor's soul is busted, a lot is broken. But this wealth of information, being able to call upon at it at will, is truely broken.

&#x200B;

If one goes back and reads Sazed's words however, he says he has difficulty recalling normal memory as he's too accustom to the metal minds (see books one & two of mistborn). His memory improoves after his love's death and refutes the metal minds (see book 3), but the power of this knowledge corrected the planet post godhood.

The arcanum is quick to say hemalurgy is of the most use to the cosmere as a whole, and this I don't disagree with, e.g. spiking a spren to providing its attributes to a non-spren; yet feruchemy feels the most broken.",1682892955.0

I am a brand new BS reader and have only read the Emperor’s Soul - which I loved.

I enjoy fantasy and recently purchased Tress and Warbreaker since they were the only BS books available at a local book store my fiancé and I visited recently.

I’m about to leave for my wedding/honeymoon in Victoria, BC and am looking for a new book to take with me.

Which one would you recommend for someone on a romantic vacation? I know BS wrote Warbreaker on his honeymoon, but from what I understand, Tress of the Emerald Sea would also be a delightful book to read on my trip as well.

Thank you for reading and sharing advice!

Edit: Messed up the title. I’m walking through a Target.

Edit 2: thank you all for the suggestions! I will be reading Warbreaker. And for those of you concerned that I will be reading instead of enjoying my honeymoon. I will probably only read 100-150 pages over the span of our 6 days out of the country. This will just be a great way of having a book that builds on the atmosphere of my honeymoon.",1682722608.0

I'm doing a reread on Mistborn right now and part of the Lord Rulers plan seems...Nonsensical to me. Ive got some base assumptions that might be incorrect, and then some questions

Assumptions:

1. The Lord Ruler knows that Hemalurgy is Ruins whole shtick and that people with spikes can be corrupted by Ruin.
2. He also knows that Ruin plans on destroying the planet, and realistically doesn't want that to happen.

  
Heres where my question comes up: Why in any universe, knowing these 2 things, would he go around making not 1, but 3 different kinds of bad ass super powerful Hemallurgic constructs in The Inquisitors, the Koloss, and the Kandra. He never even had to open the can of worms that is Hemalurgy if he didn't want to, its not like you can accidentally spike people(at least I thought you needed intent to do it). He basically knowingly made an all powerful and extremely resilient army for his #1 sworn enemy. It just doesn't seem to make sense that he would do that knowing what he knew.

BAM Location?,28,132e8a2,Cosmere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/132e8a2/bam_location/,14,"Is BAM just in the Everstorm? If the sealing of BAM disconnected the singers, and the first thing the Everstorm actually did in its first pass around the world was plug the singers back in, it seems fairly intuitive that they are related. With the other theory that >!Chanarach's death!< was the cause of the True Desolation, the current in-world explanation that the Everstorm is solely responsible for the True Desolation no longer holds up. In that case, the purpose of the convoluted plots and rituals to summon the Everstorm would have been to reactivate the Singers, something that should require BAM. 

The Stormfather described the Everstorm as ""a new thing, but of old design"". What if the old design was not the mechanism of resurrection of the Fused, but of the thing Connecting all the Singers? Despite having POVs of the Fused and Unmade, none of them seem to be concerned with finding the sealed BAM the same way Restares and the Ghostbloods are. It would make sense if they already have her working for them, but a version that has been unmade again as punishment for the False Desolation.

From a Doylist perspective, so much importance was placed onto the Everstorm in WoR and the beginning of Oathbringer, only for it to kinda fade into the background is suspect. The only weapons of Odium that are at the level of the Everstorm are the Unmade, yet outside of a mention prior to its summoning by Pattern in WoR that it is a spren, it is barely treated as alive. It fit's Brandon's MO for writing twists that one of the most powerful of the antagonists and potential McGuffin is already in the story since the second book, and locating her will not be enough to bring back the dead Shardblades.

Is this a common theory? I feel like its super intuitive on reread, yet most BAM theories I found are centered around her being in a gemstone somewhere.",1682727463.0

It will not make sense for Honor to switch to humans if the humans had broken their promise, or Odium to suddenly abandon the destructive humans. So my theory is:

Odium brought the humans from Ashyn after they destroyed that world. I was thinking maybe the Hatred Odium had influenced their society, and caused them to use the Dawnshard to attack each other. After destroying Ashyn, Odium wants to defeat Honor and Cultivation using their flaws with the help of the destructive Ashyn survivors.

The humans, after witnessing the destruction of their homeworld, refuse to engage in violence. Honor and Cultivation took pity on them and gave them Shinovar to cultivate. Over time, Shinovar became fertile lands.

The Parshendi believe that the Shards gave the humans the best lands of Roshar to settle, and grew to resent the humans for residing there and the Shards for allowing them to settle there.

The Parshendi attacked the humans in raids, therefore breaking the peace agreement between the humans and the Parshendi. Honor thus abandoned them and helped the humans, and Cultivation assisted Honor. Odium, realizing the potential of the Parshendi and disappointed by the humans, switched to help the Parshendi in their vendetta.
