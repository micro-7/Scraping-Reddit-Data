"God said, ‟Adam, I want you to do something for me.”

Adam said, ‟Gladly, Lord, what do You want me to do?” 

God said, ‟Go down into that valley...” 

Adam said, ‟What’s a valley?” 

God explained it to him.  Then God said, ‟Cross the River.”

Adam said, ‟What’s a river?” 

God explained that to him, and then said, ‟Go over to the hill …” 

Adam said, ‟What is a hill?” 

So, God explained to Adam what a  hill was then told Adam, ‟On the other side of the hill you’ll find a cave...” 

Adam said, ’What’s a cave?’ 

After God explained, He said, ‟In the cave you’ll find a woman...” 

Adam said, ‟What’s a woman?’   

So God explained that to him, too. Then God said, ”I want you to reproduce...‟

Adam said, ”How do I do that?‟ 

God first said (under His breath), ”Geez …‟ 

And then, just like everything else,  God explained that to Adam as well.

So, Adam goes down into the valley, across the river, and over the hill, into the cave, and finds the woman.

In about five minutes, he was back.

God, His patience wearing thin, said angrily, ”What is it?‟

Adam said, ”What’s a headache?‟",jruy3k0,False,,,0,Jokes,,Armlessgaskin,1689285809.0,800,800,0

"Adam was tired of being the only human around, so he went to God to ask for another. 

God said, ""Ok Adam, I will make a type of human that is intelligent, sensitive, kind, loving, beautiful, and that will make you feel amazing. The only catch is that you will have to give up one of your hands.""

"God and Eve

  
“God, I have a problem.”  
“What’s the problem Eve?”  
“I know that you created me and provided this beautiful garden and all of these wonderful animals, as well as that hilarious comedic snake, but I’m just not happy.”  
“And why is that, Eve?”  
“God, I am lonely and bored, and I’m sick to death of apples!”  
“Well, Eve, in that case, I have a solution. I shall create a man for you.”  
“Man? What is that God?”  
“A flawed, base creature, with many bad traits. He’ll lie, cheat, and be vain. He will be witless and will revel in childish things. He’ll be bigger than you and will like fighting, hunting and killing things. He won’t be too smart, so he will need your advice to think properly. He will have a very limited emotional capacity and will need to be trained. He will look silly when he is aroused but since you’ve been complaining, I’ll create him in such a way that he will satisfy your physical needs. And you most certainly will never be bored again!”  
“Sounds great” says Eve, with ironically raised eyebrows, “but what’s the catch God?”  
“Well… you can have him on one condition.”  
“And what’s that God?”  
“As I said, he’ll be proud, arrogant and self-admiring… so you’ll have to let him believe I made him first. And it will have to be our little secret. You know, woman to woman.”",jrvbk2w,False,,,0,Jokes,,PigHillJimster,1689291911.0,199,199,0
