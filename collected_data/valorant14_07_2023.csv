Are there a lot of players over the age of 25?,871,14yrzao,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14yrzao/are_there_a_lot_of_players_over_the_age_of_25/,426,"I‚Äôm turning 30 this year and feel ancient in this game sometimes ü§£. 

I‚Äôve been gaming with a squad for a year or so now (we‚Äôre so old some of us met on LinkedIn haha). We‚Äôre all over 25. Ranging from mid 20s to mid 40s I think. 

I think it would be cool though to get a bunch of adults together in a server to be able to easily scrim, duo, trio, 5 stack, build premiere teams, etc. 

Idk, are there a lot of us? Would love to meet other adult gamers (we are on NA east). Seems like a lot of my games are filled with kids (or maybe adults that just don‚Äôt talk).

Also ‚Äî I‚Äôm not knocking anyone under 25. Y‚Äôall are great haha, just nice to be able to relate with people outside of just being a Valorant player.

Iron lobbies are hell,575,14yc3lq,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14yc3lq/iron_lobbies_are_hell/,166,"Don't get me wrong, I'm in no means good at the game. My util using isn't 100% right. I get too agressive sometimes, my ain couldn't be worse and I really need to work on my crosshair placement. 

But I was able to get into bronze last act on my own and it got really better. Placement matches fucked me over as all 5 games a teammate left the game making it a 4v5 each time. Only ended up winning one of those games.

But! Iron lobbies are genuinely such an anomaly in my eyes. It's ranked not unranked but half the players there play it as of it's unranked. Instalocking an agent only to say midgame its their very first time playing the ageny so their util use is either non existent or dog shit. They leave mid game (seems like it's happening every odd game to me). Or they're throwing like hell. 4 dualists comps where I'm either Fade or Sage, yet I'll be the one ending up top fragging and doing all the work. 

And don't get me started on the lack of comms. You don't need to use voice just text that they're pushing from behind. Don't just say nothing and then get angry at us cuz they shot us in the back too.  

Players in iron don't seem to know it's a teamgame either and just go off doing whatever they feel like leaving me to hang dry on my own, holding site while they're off pushing all over site leaving me really vulnerable. 

And I won't lie, whenever something like that happens it really affects my mental and I start playing worse which of course diminishes the chances of us winning even more.

Okay thanks for coming to my tedtalk",1689227139.0

BLD sScary is GIGACHADSON This guy's life is really interesting.,75,14ygiya,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14ygiya/bld_sscary_is_gigachadson_this_guys_life_is/,6,"sScary explain why he choice bleed esports to complete ascension but not a team in the league ?

I Just watched his lifelong interview on FPSThailand to day. The video is 3 hours long and he tells the story from his birth to present day. He explained everthing why he came to bleed esports(BLD). 

Before the league started, 10 teams from non-leagues wanted to buy him and 6 teams from leagues wanted him to. He didn't say what the other 15 teams is, because he didn't want to get in trouble with the teams he didn't join. 

sScray decided to stay for a long time and rejected many teams until BLD approached him for the 5th time and offered him a huge sum of money. 

For sScary He has two goals in life. 

In short term, he wants himself and his team to win the league or masters or world championships. 

In long term, he wanted to live a life with a lot of money for retirement and help his family debt. 

And he choice long term goal His family had a debt of 7m baht(aound 200K USD). After he decided to enter BLD and received the money, he called his parents to come over to him. before transferring 7 million bath to pay debts to the family And he also transferred another 1m baht to his parents to spend in life.  

His father was ill and retired early. Causing his mother to be the only person in the house who still has to work and pay debts. As for sScay, he has been earning money to spend himself since the age of 17 from opening a pirated minecraft sever. He has lived like this until he graduated from university. Without asking for money from his parents, there was only tuition money that his parents were willing to pay because they wanted him to finish university.

when he pays his family debt His parents were crying because they didn't think that the boy they raise and used to scold and hit with clothes hanger every time he was addicted to video games would end the family's debt problems. 

 GIGACHADSON indeed.  

About the money he did not explain how much money he earn from BLD was. I'm guessing it should go up to 1m USD because he said interview . almost the rest of the money is around 80 percent after he pay debt for his familly, he invests them in business and keeps it for retirement.

A question for anyone out there with sick aim,57,14ygeef,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14ygeef/a_question_for_anyone_out_there_with_sick_aim/,63,"I'm still quite new to Valorant and it's my first ever FPS game(if we don't count my messing around in CS 1.6 back when I was like 7 years old). I started playing around the end of May and to say I was a bit overwhelmed would be an understatement. 


My main issue is that my aim is trash. I mostly get body shots according to Valo Tracker and I do get more headshots than leg shots(thank god for that) but, in general, I find myself losing duels a lot because I might get 4 body shots on someone but they'll always headshot me. I also find myself getting owned a lot by crouch sprayers because I trained my cursor placement at roughly head level and then my reaction time when someone crouches is so slow, I'm dead by the time I drag my crosshair lower to headshot them. About 7/10 times I lose to a crouch sprayer. 


So my main question is: how do I improve my aim? Is there actually a sweet spot for crosshair placement? Should I start crouch spraying too?(I genuinely don't know when I should/shouldn't crouch as I never really do it.). 


One other tidbit of information is that my best weapon overall seems to be the Ghost of all things. I tend to do better on pistol rounds and will sometimes fall onto using Ghost even when my whole team are using Vandals. My 2nd best is the Vandall and I do use it a lot but the Ghost seems to be my comfort weapon. Heck, I was playing KJ on Lotus yesterday and for most of the rounds I was top fragging and my team even mentioned how ""everyone using Vandals and dying and here's KJ with a Ghost carrying us."". 


So adding from that, how do I get more comfortable with other guns? I can only reliably use Ghost, Spectre and Vandall, everything else is just strange to me. I can't use snipers, I don't get in people's faces so shotguns are very situational, I feel like a small child when holding an Odin and quite frankly I don't even know the names of the other guns for the most part. They get overlooked so much I feel like an absent mother to my children so to speak. 


Sorry, I bet you guys get these questions a lot but I'd really like to improve so I don't feel like a burden to my teams 8/10 times. Thanks in advance!",1689241798.0

Valorant Agents in the style of Soulsborne/Elden Ring Bosses! Entry 2-- Viper (art by me!),1,14z4rpr,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14z4rpr/valorant_agents_in_the_style_of_soulsborneelden/,0,"[Viper Boss Art](https://imgur.com/gallery/cHvBzC7)

Second installment in my crossover between Valorant agents in a Soulsborne boss style, Viper! A fascinating character with plenty of potential for souls lore, this was a very fun piece to consider the details of :)

Some design notes:

\- I feel like Viper would play into her strengths as a controller in her fight, coming off as an unassuming easy target, then filling the arena with her toxins as soon as the player attempts to strike. (From within the noxious fog, something massive slithers from all directions.) 

\- My original idea was to lean into body modification, and have her lower half be a snake woman, lamia-esque. However, Dark Souls 2 already has a boss like that, Mytha, the Baneful Queen. She's a unique boss that also has poison mechanics, so I felt that taking that route would feel too borrowed from existing characters. 

\- Instead, I chose to lean towards her toxician path in my outfit design, while maintaining snake motifs. I took heavy inspiration from plague doctors, and gave her mask a variation of the classic beak shape combined with her gas filters on the sides. Her neck cowl connects to the mask similarly, and her pouch and belt with rounded poison bottles fits the vibe as well. 

\- In terms of snake motifs, I wanted to keep the ""Viper"" in the design, so her shoulder pauldrons and arm braces are styled to be somewhat reminiscent of viper horns. Along with the viper spirit summon, and the one on her arm as well, I felt I kept it pretty on the nose lol. 

\- (The classic Plague Doc boss is Crystal Sage, from DS3, and despite being a mid boss at best, I've drawn inspiration from its themes for both boss designs that I've made so far lmfao) anwyays, thanks for reading this far :) which agent should I do next? ",1689304411.0
TLDR: Why can't I win?,462,14xvklc,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14xvklc/tldr_why_cant_i_win/,185,"I don't want to be the guy that always blames his teammates, because half the time, they're actually great. However, as a solo-queue Omen main, I really don't know what's happening here. Since the rank reset I just cannot win anymore, if I do, it's maybe a game where the whole lobby is iron. I do believe I'm consistent in frags, and I *think* I'm good with my utility, especially on defence. I don't know if it's just bad team chemistry from being solo-queue or just bad luck? Or even just me being a d\*\*k and somehow falling back to the super original ""My teammates suck!""

2. To reach bronze I had to understand the game, but people don't so another frustration starts like walking like horses, don't care about the spike and SMURF players with 30-5 kills killing my matches.   
3. God finnaly in silver, people know how to play right? Yeah but if someone don't think like You they start afk and trolling with Phoenix.    
4. After reaching gold I just decided to stop, I don't get how I spent hours testing my skills and Weapon control to someone kill me behind a wall, Operator players using 144hz monitor and other hardware better than mine. Instalock duelist, closed parties and so much more.

Chamber needs these QOL changes,0,14z47rt,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14z47rt/chamber_needs_these_qol_changes/,4,"I've recently had a bit of frustration on this, playing chamber. It's specifically how awkward it can be to recall his trip (c) and tp pylon (e).

I'm a little bit confused as to why we cant just have it be like KJ's util? Hold said button down to recall said util. 

The reason it matters so much is because the cooldown only starts as soon as u recall them, unless u just used ur tp (and in this case, its not a problem really, but still). Having to turn around to recall ur tp and ur trip leaves u very exposed to beng shot if ur flanking or going somewhere away from safety, not to mention how tedious and just unecessary it is. 

Just making this post to see if anyone else shares these thoughts, being able to recall trip and tp without having to 180¬∞ would be a much needed QOL change IMO. I tried thinking of good reasons to keep it as is, but I cant rly find any reason as to why.

1. Iron rank I just had to deal with players with no skill, horrible net connection and 0 communication.   
2. To reach bronze I had to understand the game, but people don't so another frustration starts like walking like horses, don't care about the spike and SMURF players with 30-5 kills killing my matches.   
3. God finnaly in silver, people know how to play right? Yeah but if someone don't think like You they start afk and trolling with Phoenix.    
4. After reaching gold I just decided to stop, I don't get how I spent hours testing my skills and Weapon control to someone kill me behind a wall, Operator players using 144hz monitor and other hardware better than mine. Instalock duelist, closed parties and so much more.",1689289609.0

Our Astra would always stand at a corner in spawn, and keep concussing us with her ability, or pulls us away in a gun fight. This happened every single round. So Sova, KJ, and Raze decided to just kill Astra with their abilities right after the round start so she can no longer troll on us. After the game I got a behavioral warning from Riot. What the heck man. This is just so unfair. Tell me, Riot, what else could we have done? How would you handle this situation?",1689286418.0

Tracking Pro maps,1,14ywthw,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14ywthw/tracking_pro_maps/,1,"Hello

I recently wanted to start a new programming project. The idea was to create an app or website that would display the statistical positioning of professional players in pro maps. For example the project would display that 92% of Professional Sova players play back site on Haven C. 

My question does anyone have any idea of current websites or places where I can obtain this data or if there is currently a live map website that always displays player positions in pro games. As when the observers go into a players POV you lose the enemy positioning on the map. 

If there is nothing like this, the plan is just to use a bot to record player positions through the live streams.  Thank you for all and any help.",1689283096.0

There are also friends who are at the same rank as me but as we climb, they also get higher RR than me even though their score are lower.

if it's because of me, then how can I improve my RR gains.

In what way does this encourage climbing ranks? 

To put an example, I lost a game to a Reyna diamond 2, placed platinum 2 that went 39/15. 39 KILLS. And I am gold 3. So how exactly do I rank up if every game I have to face diamonds from the previous act? There is always someone getting over 25-30 kills and I just can't beat them. I've even gotten paired against ascendants, like WHAT?

I am not blaming the high ranks, I am blaming this system, you just can't say ""be better"" over someone who is 3 whole ranks above you, it just isn't fair. 

I wouldn't mind if the reset was within your own rank, for example, from dia 3 you go to dia 1 at 0 points or whatever but stay in diamond, why go below that and ruin the matches of those who just got to gold? The diamond player clearly earned their spot there so why remove them?

I am using gold/plat/dia as my examples as I am currently g3 after the reset, but you can imagine how this affects low and higher ranks too.

And I've always maintained that I've felt like Valorant has had one of the best, least toxic, and generally positive communities I've ever played in, sincerely. Especially by FPS standards, the people in Valorant are *very* nice and friendly. 

&nbsp;

I've felt like that's changing though. The past 6!!! games I've gotten have had either mic spammers, trolls, or people who are just outright unpleasant to talk to or comm with. Its become a more common sight these days I feel like. Its gotten to the point where I've felt the desire to just automatically mute voice chat when the game starts. It feels like every game I join is filled with some teens moaning in the might, yelling on a low quality mic, shit talking and whining constantly, disparaging the team, etc. 

&nbsp;

Is this the experience with anyone else? I've always been an insanely extroverted, communicative, and outgoing person. I used to make new friends on Valorant every day I played because I would be talking a lot with people. In games like Squad, I would often times take up the role of a leader and communicate with 15 different people at once because I liked that role, I liked talking to people and I was good at it! I'm feeling this less and less with Valorant though. Its insanely discouraging. 

&nbsp;

Also similarly has anyone felt like more people are not using Valorant voice chat and instead using Discord instead? I feel like in many games its obvious I'm not being comm'd with because I'm not in the group VC a 3 or 4 stack is in, so they just don't bother to try and talk with me. I think its a result of degrading communication quality these days IMO.",1689189854.0

I‚Äôve been a controller fps sweat for 20 years so I feel justified giving my input with the natural game sense I‚Äôve built in that time. 

Firstly, I love this character and it suits my playstyle. This isn‚Äôt a deadlock bad post. 

- Several surfaces block sound sensors. Anything that isn‚Äôt a smooth texture is finicky to place on, and some smooth textures aren‚Äôt placeable at all. Inside A main on Split, for example. You can‚Äôt sensor the darker gray bottom portion of the entry. There are several instances across maps where sensors have a flat surface but are unplaceable, and then most textures that aren‚Äôt smooth (like criss crossed boards) require some perfect angle to find a sensor spot. 

Without being able to place on the floor/ceiling to compensate, I hate this. 

- The ult. I don‚Äôt think it needs talked about much. We‚Äôre all aware of the hot mess it is right now. It‚Äôs a wildly fun ult to use, be it predicting enemies, trapping with the grav net for a free grab, forcing a trade on attack in a 1v1 last standing scenario, it has a ton of utility. It‚Äôs just so wildly inconsistent regarding things it will get stuck on, sometimes catching people outside the tunnel while other times missing people in the center of it, cocoon‚Äôs seemingly varied hp in some instances. Yikes. 

- Grav net seems close but doesn‚Äôt seem quite utile enough. Probably just my low elo games here. 

All in all, she‚Äôs such a fun character. On attack or defense, I feel like I have so much control over the entire round so long as I‚Äôm reading enemy movement right. 

Great character, just needs smoothing.",1689177618.0

Help: Deathmatch vs Comp,0,14y70uv,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14y70uv/help_deathmatch_vs_comp/,3," 

Since the release of Team Deathmatch I have been using it as a warm-up and then going straight to ranked. The problem is.... I'm insane in deathmatch, sometimes pop-off insanely in ranked but most of the time im just... bad.

From all the 20 games of Team Deathmatch that I've played, I've gotten 17 Match MVPs averaging 30kills+ wiith my highest being 52 kills. The other 3 matches i got 3rd, 4th and 5th.

To be honest I don't know what my problem is. Is it ranked stress? Deathmatch confidence? Not playing the same? (clearly).

I no longer use crouch at all since it affected my dueling (imo). Does anyone have any ideas of what i can do?

My last two matches were a 51 kills Team Deathmatch and straight away went to comp. I went like 1-14 and just gave up. Im on the verge of madness.",1689212206.0

Battlepass Progression...the devestating truth,14,14xksn1,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14xksn1/battlepass_progressionthe_devestating_truth/,26,"I did some number crunching and if I am not wrong you need to at least following to finish your battlepass:

\- complete all your weeklies

\- complete all your dailies on every day ==> 80 min per day (8x team deatchmatch)

\- when missed on one day you need to play 110 extra minutes on another day to compensate

This results in a minimum required time of \~75h per battle pass...

I saw during Pro play VODs about how they split their hit to multiple sites and mid during attacking rounds (""default""). It looks very useful to get information about the defenders' formation and hit their weaker site.

Anyway, I tried to replicate that in my Bronze lobby during buy rounds, where I comm my intention to default. I also comm to not commit to any site till we have enough information. But more often than not, 4 of my fellow teammates will go the other site, and will hit it before I get any information about the other site. Or they ignore my comms to rotate, when I have a clear or have cleared the other site.

And when they die, more often than not they will flame me for being a lurking Reyna. Whereas my main idea is not about lurking but defaulting. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!",1689208420.0

I was the same way, every bad game would cause me to get upset. When I was upset, it became more difficult to focus, but I was also blaming everything for my death besides for myself. So, one day a couple weeks ago, in a ranked match, I met arguably the nicest people I met playing this game. I remember we lost that game, and I hadn't done so well. However, those peoples kindness sort of relieved me in a way. After that, my mindset shifted. I started approaching my team with a kinder approach. I'll hop on the mic during selection and jus say hello and ask how peoples days went. During games, when I die, I don't get tilted and start blaming everything else, I simply say wp or ns, then compliment some way on how they outplayed me. This helps me identify what I did wrong to lose and die, but also I've noticed people can't really talk down on you if you're doing nothing but being nice to them. Since this mindset change, I have felt an overall improvement on not only my team, nor the lobby, but I feel like I'm improving way faster than I was before , because I am identifying my mistakes, and ENJOYING when I play, even if I am not doing the best.

Creating a Woohoojin/Valorant Documentary,1,14xx82v,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14xx82v/creating_a_woohoojinvalorant_documentary/,3,"Hey I‚Äôm a small Valorant Youtuber, bvtter, looking to create a Documentary about **Woohoojin** and **Valorant**. I want to find players with *any* experience watching Woohoojin, any experience in his community and how it‚Äôs impacted your experience with Valorant and Ranking up.

&#x200B;

If you‚Äôre curious here‚Äôs a short example with **my own story**:

When I first started watching Woohoojin, I was a brand new Bronze player looking to rank up, and as all new low elo players do. I looked up tips and tricks on Youtube, at first all the videos I found were extremely generic and things I had already heard a million times, nothing really substantial or all that helpful. That was until I found a Woohoojin Video, **‚ÄúGunfight Hygiene‚Äù**. It completely changed how I took duels in Valorant. Eventually leading me to Silver, but I wanted more, and as a result I ended up finding Woohoojins **‚ÄúOne Month To Gold‚Äù** Routine. This routine not only made me a Platinum player but also a long-time viewer and member of the community.

&#x200B;

Of course your own story could be as brief as ‚ÄúI enjoyed one video and it helped me with a concept in Valorant‚Äù or as long as explaining how, ‚Äúthe community completely changed how you see Valorant, Aim, and Gaming‚Äù. **All experiences, ranks and backgrounds are welcome.**

&#x200B;

If you‚Äôre interested in being apart of this Documentary in any way please reach out.

I would love to speak to players with experiences in discord vc's, but I also really appreciate written out responses as well.

I will be reading responses in the comments, my DMs, and my Discord: @ bvtter\_

Thank you for reading!

What agent to play it with, when to buy, which spots on which maps to hold with it, how to attack with it, practice routines etc.

I thought of the Operator as an overpowered but boring weapon that needed patience till I watched a professional player named KangKang, who currently plays for the Chinese pro Val team EDward Gaming, use the Operator at the Masters Tokyo event and since then I've been obsessed.

[https://youtu.be/aOWh9JlV\_gM?t=135](https://youtu.be/aOWh9JlV_gM?t=135)

I've been buying the OP a lot since watching the event and sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. I'll be holding Pearl B long I've figured out that I can't die with it at least for 2 rounds after I buy it, regardless of kills, and per round it's not great value unless I can get a 2k at least. A common scenario is I'll be holding Pearl B long from hall and I'll get one kill before getting traded instantly by a Vandal. If I am lucky I escape with one body shot then re-peek and get a second frag before getting traded. I have better success when attacking from Ascent mid-top, I don't know why I just find it easier to re-adjust my aim across the various potential enemy peek spots.

I want to improve with the weapon. I don't have crazy ambitions of becoming Radiant or becoming a pro player or streamer, I have a full time job so I get to play max 1-2 hours a day. I love the weapon, it's an absolute thrill to play with it. Almost match-winning potential on it's own, and it can completely fuck your economy up for several rounds if you buy it and lose your first duel.

Across over 300 kills this person has maintained almost a 70% hs. This also wasn't a scenario in which it's someone not shooting/getting kills frequently leading to a skewed statistic because the few kills were headshots. This person was consistently at the top of the leaderboard. My other friends who are in the higher immortal to low radiant elo range don't typically have that high of a hs%, even on their alts. A little deeper digging showed that in previous acts his vandal hs% hovered around the mid 30s to low 40s, which is still high but not quite 70% high. 

I was curious to see what people's thoughts were on at what point you'd consider the possibility of a cheater versus just being a powerhouse smurf. Especially in light of vanguard being out of compliance and thus not running properly on some windows 10 OS builds currently

Introducing Valodle.eu: A New Game of Daily Valorant Agent Guessing,254,14wbz62,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14wbz62/introducing_valodleeu_a_new_game_of_daily/,78,"Hello everyone!

I'm thrilled to introduce you all to my newly created website - [**Valodle.eu**](https://www.valodle.eu/)!

In essence, Valodle.eu is inspired by the concept of Loldle (for those who aren't familiar). The primary objective is to test your Valorant knowledge every day by guessing the randomly selected agent. It's a fun way to challenge your memory and maybe even learn something new about the agents that you didn't know before!

But that's not all! I've got a lot of exciting things planned for Valodle in the future. One of the features that I'm particularly thrilled to introduce is a Geo Guesser mode. In this mode, players will need to identify the map based on a screenshot. It's a fun, innovative, and challenging twist that I hope will keep you engaged and guessing!

Additionally, another game mode that's in the works will require players to identify the name of a weapon skin from an image. This will certainly be a challenge for even the most die-hard Valorant fans, as it will test not only your knowledge of the game's weaponry but also your attention to detail.

And of course, there are many more features and modes that I'm looking forward to introducing. Valodle is all about making the world of Valorant more interactive and engaging, while also providing a fun and challenging gaming experience.

I would love for you all to visit the site, give it a try, and let me know your thoughts. Your feedback will be instrumental in making Valodle the best it can be. I'm looking forward to hearing what you think and seeing you there!

Happy guessing, everyone!

Hard reset every new episode is a good thing for people who play alot at higher ranks. Heres why.,0,14xc12r,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14xc12r/hard_reset_every_new_episode_is_a_good_thing_for/,3,"Valorant has this very awful feature where every new act, all you have to do is play one  game, win or lose and you‚Äôre placed at the same rank you hit last act. Meaning people can just grind the start of the new episode, reach their peak rank and just play 1 game each new act and stay the same rank. I think this is a horrible feature in higher ranks where people play hours upon hours. Getting one of these players that plays only like 3 games an act is a guaranteed loss. This is probably the reason why you find yourself saying ‚Äú how is this person not in iron?‚Äù Its probably because they havent played in months. And thanks for valorants rank system they‚Äôre allowed to play in the peak elo they hit in the beginning of the act.



I think this is incredibly harmful for the game and the player. That is why, the beginning of each act are the best games you‚Äôre going to get the entire episode. Once you climb back to your peak after the rank reset, you will find that the majority of the players there are also players like you putting in a lot of hours to reach their rank again. The games dont feel one sided, you dont have teamates droping zero kills in 20 rounds. I think its the best time to climb to a higher rank. 

I would suggest that the amount of games played within the act determines your rank for the next act. Someone that has played one f** game the whole act should not end up the same rank as their previous act. That causes horrible unbalanced, unwinable games. I also think the reset shouldnt matter. I was ascendant 2 and got placed diamond 1. If you‚Äôre a playing consistently, you should get back to your main rank pretty quickly.",1689130870.0

However i still lost 16 rr and was deranked. I felt it was really unfair and at least riot should have a protection point system where you get protection points everytime someone griefs your match and when it hits a threshold (like 100) you get no deduction upon losing a match.

Most of the time my aim sucks. I guess it has to do with panic bursting and my aim in general. Sorry I do not have a recording to show for review. My confidence usually plunges down when faced with enemies in a deadly situation.
I can't even play duelist without fighting my thoughts or without a friend lol! 


Competitive games really sucks when you have low confidence I guess. I'm fighting against those thoughts but it can't be done in one day...I rarely crouch and I try to deadzone a lot (I prob still isn't good with it) while in game I always forget to shoot head as all I'm focused with is killing the enemies.. 

The key is probably to play a lot since I only started last February, but yeah I still enjoy the game I'm just sad that I don't headshot a lot.  My overall % for headshot is like... Only 8.4% ... Body 80.8% :/ it probably doesn't matter as long as you kill an enemy and win the round but I want to improve on that... 


I'm in bronze 1 last act I was silver 1 and it's hard to get out of bronze rn somehow people are just too good! But it's not like i wanna give up cus i love the game I'm just ranting and sad. I love Valorant sm. 


Maybe I could get some even more tips, things to remember and more vids to absorb. Like a keyword or a sentence I won't ever forget to remind myself I can do it :))

Recently, I've noticed myself flaming my teammates, shouting, even just being upset in general playing this game. I of course know that being toxic only limits my team and demotivates the whole lobby, basically losing the match immediately, but I really don't know what to do about it. I've taken breaks, watched some feel-good valorant content like Woohoojin, played unrated, played only with friends, and still had to stop playing due to feeling bad.

Killjoy her Chicken Turret IN REAL LIFE!? AND MUCH MORE COOL STUFF!,12,14wmpp0,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14wmpp0/killjoy_her_chicken_turret_in_real_life_and_much/,4,"Hii people!

&#x200B;

I created Killjoy her Chicken Turret in real life!!! Here you can see it:

[https://gyazo.com/2cd810378e6ce7bf1b6d31bf0d232849](https://gyazo.com/2cd810378e6ce7bf1b6d31bf0d232849)

It's 77cm in height, but I added wheels to it. At some point I want to make the turret remote controllable so I dont need to drag it along with a little rope on conventions.

&#x200B;

Also some other cool stuff I have made: 

Glitchpop Dagger WITH LEDS!

[https://gyazo.com/61b0fb58e9a7896931dffb9f71e4e205](https://gyazo.com/61b0fb58e9a7896931dffb9f71e4e205)

This was a hard challenge cus it was my first ever LED project. But I love it!!!

&#x200B;

Reaver Operator:

I made this one for a friend who mainly plays operator.

Made this one for a friend who is a filthy Jett main.

I haven't been fortunate enough ( yet) to earn this one in game so I decided to make it as a keychain. And people are in love with it!

&#x200B;

And to show more addiction, I got the VCT logo tattoo'ed.

Would love to hear what you think!!

I am currently working on a Reaver Vandal with LEDs aswell and my next big build will be KAY/O. 

I want to build KAY/O armor with LEDs aswell! ( long term project)

I don't know if this is a lore thing or just riot not having ideas but I've noticed that sentinels and duelists are heavily one sided in terms of humans and/or radiants. With sentinels sage is the only radiant of the bunch. And with Deadlock now in the game it means there are 5 sentinels and one of them is radiant. (I'm pretty sure that's the lore name for the characters with supernatural powers but correct me if I'm wrong). And this ratio is even worse with duelists. There are 6 duelists (I think) and raze is the only human duelist. So what's the deal with this. I'm not criticizing riot I'm just curious. I'd personally love to see more human duelists.

Completely Separate MMR Per Mode Ruins Casual Mode for Low Elo Players,5,14wee19,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14wee19/completely_separate_mmr_per_mode_ruins_casual/,47,"I understand that the competitive integrity of the more casual modes isn't nearly as important as in the main Comp mode and speed of matchmaking is generally more important with each team in my reference game being roughly balanced out, but I think there should still be a rank distance cap or relative range, especially for people who are soloQ-ing or who are with people that are super close to their rank. I use TDM and Deathmatch to warm up and find it incredibly frustrating to queue into people from Diamond all the way to high tier pro play and essentially get forced to waste five to ten minutes just getting rolled by people better than me. I can't imagine how irritating it is for your average Joe to just be getting on to have fun with their buds and end up queuing into SR vIc or something because they happen to be on a bit of a winstreak that night.

Edit: For those of you saying to just play ranked, two points. 

1: If I only have 45 minutes to play on a given day, I can't guarantee that I'd be able to play the whole game if it goes to later rounds or OT. 

2: If I die in a round, I'm out for the round, if I die in TDM, I'm back in a gunfight within 10-15 seconds or faster if I pick Raze or Neon, which would be a far more time efficient way to practice.

I haven't played the game in a long time, maybe even a year. I had an account that was in the Gold 3 to Platinum 1 range, but my skill has dropped a bit so I decided to create a new account for this Act and start fresh. I've been playing for a couple weeks now and just unlocked Ranked, upon which I immediately played all five of my placement games. The game placed me in Gold 2, which surprised me quite a bit. I expected to get Bronze or even Silver at best, especially considering I didn't perform well for 3 out of 5 of my placements.

My team dont want me to play yoru(me and my friend argument),0,14wm6go,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14wm6go/my_team_dont_want_me_to_play_yorume_and_my_friend/,4,"I am a plat2 player.  From the start reyna and chamber were my solid choice because I want a ability which  can get 1v1 and escape for another 1v1. In reyna its her dismiss and chamber it is teleport. After the chamber nerf I stop using him since even for a sentinel he became a bad choice.

Which led me to play reyna(150hours) but lately I started seeing the disadvantage of reyna, I am forced to take 50/50 fight (her blind sucks). So I switched to yoru on last act. Yoru is a good agent for me since it have a amazing flash and a way to escape bad situation. 

I  am top fragging most of the times and playing the dualist role better than before, more confident in ult and supporting team is gotten much better since I can just tp in a sec from site to site. But here is the problem.

My teammate which I am playing with since the start of my valo journey, complains that I flash them which I dont think is true. There been only few situation where I flashed them by mistake, for example- on bind 'A' site, I am about to peak through showers to give my team more area to work from, so rather than peaking raw, I threw a flash on the entrance and it got my friend flash who was planting. That was my fault indeed but it was not a selfish flash. Another time it happened which started this argument. 

The map is pearl and I am taking A main control alone to kill the lurker cypher, I slowly pushed to their spawn to clear mid but I see that my team is struggling to hold B control because of enemy being 5stack. I decided to go fast flank to divide the enemy team which will help my team on B to have an number advantage. I am on b club and I saw fade on ramp, as soon I shot at her,  timing happened and she moved to go to main. My omen(friend) decided to TP using his ult near me and I knew he is there. My gamesense said that fade gonna peak me, so I flashed at her direction to get advantage, as soon as the flash popet my omen peak from cover and got flashed, I died from fade because I missed first shot and she probably saw me before the flash popet. Fade also killed omen by skill not because omen was blind.

My friend argument was ""I dont call my flash"", my argument was ""In situation like this which need fast decision making, I cannot change my focus to calling for flash"", He said its stupid.  He started saying again that I need to stop playing yoru even though I am top fragging in most matches, I am the one who is entering site and taking control of hard areas like B tunnel and B link. The talk went like this  
Me: ""I am top fragging matches then why should I stop playing yoru. I am getting kill and having impact on the rounds"".   
friend: ""Exit frag dont have impact on the round and you said a dualist should not be the last person alive""  
me: ""I am getting 1-3 kills when entering a site and after we have man advantage, why would I get myself into pointless fight where I dont even have my abilities left""

What i love about Valorant,0,14wf8ml,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14wf8ml/what_i_love_about_valorant/,3," The game features two teams of five players each, with one team defending and the other attacking. In the attacking team, players must plant a bomb in a designated area, while the defending team tries to prevent them from doing so. The game is won by either detonating the bomb or eliminating all opponents. Valorant‚Äôs gameplay involves strategizing, teamwork, and skill, making it a highly competitive game. Each agent has unique abilities, including healing, teleportation, and invisibility, which add a layer of complexity to the gameplay. The game requires players to use their abilities smartly and work together to outmaneuver their opponents. One of the biggest features of Valorant is its striking art style and graphics. The game has a modern and futuristic aesthetic with beautifully designed maps, character models, and animations. The sound design is also impressive, with realistic gun sounds and voice lines that add to the immersive experience,

i also love this game because it has cute characters and cool gunskins

why does it seem like low elo players are allergic to playing strategically?,354,14v1bo1,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14v1bo1/why_does_it_seem_like_low_elo_players_are/,167,"I've only been playing roughly for about 4 months and managed to get a rank of bronze 1(I know this is still low). One thing I noticed, people don't/won't play to their advantage in post-plant, spike dropped or in numbers. I know I make mistakes in my plays and still have a lot to learn about the game.

In one match it was a 1v1 we were on attack. The remaining player in my team (Jett) was able to plant the spike(A). Instead of holding down the site, she went off to look for the remaining Cypher.  Cypher got to defuse while my teammate was in market.

In another match it was 2v1 the spike was dropped in t-spawn. I pinged the spike and said in comms help me defend the spike. But no, the player proceeded to go to and camp in (A lotus). I lost my 1v1 and the opponent planted in C, camped there, and got the clutch.

Another scenario 3v1. instead of playing together, all 3 went off separate ways which gave the opponent 1v1s which they lost.

I see this pattern in over and over. Majority of the time players don't listen/read comms or evaluate the situation.

I say this because the weapons is very different from another games that I play, if you move a little it will hit everything around the screen except the center of the crosshair, the best way to Master these weapons is with good hardware (keyboard, 144hz monitor, mouse).

The amount of people who lock jett/Reyna only in these lobbies while being inconsistent is a bit obnoxious.

I did search for a post asking this question but it could not be found. I am seemingly asking for the first time but the question relates to my mental health as well. I loved Overwatch 1 until 2018, after that it became meh because of the competitive nature of it (which bred even more toxicity that we didn't need). I still played it until Overwatch 2, and I stuck to Quick Play, having fun for the most part. Finding casual players and comps. 

Having only seen a tiny bit of 5v5 gameplay of Valorant, I have to ask, is there anything casual friendly in the game? 

I bring it up because my being on the autism spectrum causes me to have meltdowns over challenging content. I could handle Overwatch 1 after a while and didn't feel anything towards teammates, except toxic players.

Correct me if I got anything wrong, I only noticed this when I was trying to figure out what gun Breach had and then it went on to a game of identifying every gun all the agents were holding. I'm surprised Vandal wasn't used in a splash art since it looks pretty cool (I thought Reyna had a Vandal at first) and it's arguably the most popular gun in the game. Thoughts on this?

The new progression system is worse than before,0,14uv9fa,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14uv9fa/the_new_progression_system_is_worse_than_before/,3,"In the previous system, progression was as easy as a click on recruit and the unlocking process would begin and while you were unlocking the agent you would get a nice spray or banner. But now you get credits, which can be used to unlock agents or buy cosmetics. Now, instead of getting some cool rewards along the way of unlocking an agent, you have to sacrifice your progression to unlock those cosmetics. Some people people say this was always the case, gun skins could only be obtained from the last stage of the recruitment, after the agent could be unlocked, but this only applies to gun skins and this has only gotten worse in the new system, now you aren't even halfway to getting that gun skin after you have unlocked the agent. Now you have to get through 10 tiers just to get that gun skin instead of the previous 5 you had left after you had unlocked an agent in the previous system. 

And in defence of the new system, people say that progression is faster because of the agent unlocking that happends automatically, but this only applies to new agents and these unlocking offers are only available for a limited time.

'But okay', you may ask, 'although what you're saying is true, you still get a whole new f2p shop to buy things with your credits' But not only does buying anything from here take away fron your progression, the items on sale here are just not worthy to be bought. Yay you get to buy a banner from three seasons ago! But gun skins? No. So buying cosmetics from the agents is always superior since you get to unlock a gun skin at the end, while buying cool agent specific cosmetics that don't look as boring as the cosmetics in the credits shop.

And btw this is all from the perspective of f2p. I don't care if agents cost more real money now, but I wouldn't be surprised.",1688898787.0
Should I be using Reyna to train my aim?,3,14uot60,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14uot60/should_i_be_using_reyna_to_train_my_aim/,6,Reyna has almost no utility except her flash so she is meant to take as many raw gunfights as possible. I don't really have good aim so I want to train my aim against actual players instead of using AimLabs or the Range where you don't exactly test your skills. Should I be using Reyna to train my aim? If so I will probably only use her in Unrated because I mainly play Omen and Skye,1688876601.0

Omen on Ascent Guide,14,14uaklu,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14uaklu/omen_on_ascent_guide/,0,"Omen is the best solo controller on Ascent, and everybody should at least be familiar with the basics of him (so that you can fill).

Here's the TLDR (if you want a full, in-depth breakdown, [see the Twitter post](https://twitter.com/CoachShiro/status/1677733338264608771?s=20)):

\- On defense, always play A. If you're weak side, lean towards Tree. If you're strong side, fight hard for A main.

\- On A retake, you will typically go from Tree so you can flash Gen + Dice.

\- On B retake, you will typically go from CT because the pathing is easier. From Lane, flash jump up + default.

\- On offense, you will almost always be A/B Main. Your flash is best used on A from Main to Gen and on B from Main to Stairs. On A you don't need to smoke Heaven to take site. On B you can flash B main off-rip from B Lobby to rush fast.

\- On post-plant, you need to play for time. On A, cycle 1way smokes on Tree to prevent retakers from coming out of Tree. Dice and A main are really strong A post-plant positions for Omen. If you are playing A main, use your last smoke cycle to 1way the Spike. On B, it is best to play aggressively in post-plant before falling back, since you need both smokes for the execute. The best place to start is Lane.

Anyways, I just played two matches and in both matches we immediately started getting owned. Which means my entire team complained the whole time about smurfs on the other team. I tried explaining how I feel it‚Äôs a chance to learn how to beat players better than you and once you get mad you play worse. They weren‚Äôt having it and I think my team might have won 5 rounds combined.

Sometimes when Riot nerfs something I feel like they did a little too much. For example the recent shorty nerfs. I feel like they could have done all the damage reserve ammo ECT. changes and kept the price same or just increase the price. But for some reason they did both. Or the viper ult nerfs. They could've done all the smoke duration changes and keep it at seven  or increased the cost to 8 points. But again they did both. And let's not forget how they killed chamber. I know that all three of these were too strong before the nerfs. However I feel like they would've been turned pretty balanced if they had done only some of the changes.

Valorant's community is very weird,19,14tzm1u,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14tzm1u/valorants_community_is_very_weird/,40,"I totally enjoy Valorant's gameplay and art. It's a really fun game with really nice visuals. However, Valorant's community is very questionable. 

Every time I play, my teamates keep teasing me because I'm female and I talk in voice chat to communicate. At this point I just mute but it's annoying because talking is way easier than typing while playing. And when I play with my boyfriend if we have a girl on our team they keep flirting w him and  harassing him over voice. Why are people like that??? Like it's actually so rare for us to get decent human beings on our team, why's literally everyone on this game so horny?? it's so baffling. 

It's such a shame because both of us genuinely enjoy Valorant's gameplay and art but the majority of the games we play we end up with people like that and it completely ruins the experience, and when we mute ourselves and others on the team it becomes harder to make calls and communicate which again ruins the experience. It's so annoying lol

P.S.: I don't mean to call everyone in Valorant's community weird. I'm sure there are decent people out there but I'm just speaking from my own experience so far.",1688809123.0
need some help with my aim,2,14ugj46,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14ugj46/need_some_help_with_my_aim/,4,"Hi everyone. It's been about a week since I started playing valorant again, doing some aim training every day on aimlabs (skillcapped official playlist) and some warm-up dm's. despite this, in game I can't perform as well as in dm. I miss many shots, I shoot to the body or I lose 1v1 duels that in dm I usually win very easily (I play sheriff only aiming for the head, if you want I'll send you my video). but still, in game i can't aim...does anyone have any advice? Thank you!

**WHAT SHOULD THE NEW RANK BE CALLED -** Literally anything, could be another metal, etc  


**WHAT SHOULD COUNTERACT THE ADDED GRIND? -** They should buff the amount of RR you get when you perform good, that's plainly it

**OTHER IDEAS TO COUNTERACT THE GRIND/COOL FEATURE THAT SHOULD BE ADDED:** They should add an endorsement system, it only is in Competitive, how it works is for every endorsement you get from a teammate, you get 2-5 more RR depending on how well you did, I know its a different...view of the word ""Endorsement"" but what I mean to say is for example if a player did good for a team, great communication, great teamplay, great contribution or anything in that sort of matter, you endorse them just like the Overwatch system, you get more RR IF and only if you are not toxic, you be toxic and you're not getting any endorsements. This would be a great method on reducing the amount of toxicity in the game. a toxic player would be less toxic just because they want more RR but at the end of the day its a win win, more RR for someone, and no toxic players. This could also benefit the non-toxic well performing players as well, Thanks for coming to my ted talk!

Appreciation post!,14,14thttt,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14thttt/appreciation_post/,3,"I used to play on Mumbai servers and these servers are soo toxic! Backseating, trash-talking they do their own shit and they legit think they are good at the game even if they are dogwater doing 2 braincell plays!

I switched to SEA servers and man I feel soo good playing valorant! The skill level is definitely higher but I enjoy the game even if it's against tougher opponents! Sure there are issues with no comms and shit like that, but the toxicity level is way too low. A loss feels okay coz everyone tried without biting their teammates head off! Advices are given post-round without treating someone like a fucking worm.. If they wanna get something off their chest, it is done at the end of the game. 

If anyone plays Dota 2, you know SEA servers have absolutely troglodytes with shit-for-brains. But it's definitely not the case when it comes to VALORANT!! Thank you!


Any other non-toxic servers?

PS: Female gamers are on equal footing too in SEA, I have around 800 hours competitive(High Diamond) - No misogynists!

4. an ability to control agent voice lines better. add a cooldown for tactical callouts and phrases like with pings. add an ability to turn off automatic pre and post game voicelines 
5. map maker
6. an option to use previous home screen videos 
7. more crosshair customisation like an option to control every line independently to have different colors and other features, an option to change the outline color and add a toggle for outlines being on a separate layer below all the elements",1688767510.0
