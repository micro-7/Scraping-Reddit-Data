**[IGN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/56/ign)** - [Leana Hafer](https://opencritic.com/critic/7792/leana-hafer) - [9 / 10](https://www.ign.com/articles/jagged-alliance-3-review)

>Jagged Alliance 3 is a flexible, challenging, approachable throwback turn-based tactics game in which the only thing that feels truly dated is the humor.

-------------

**[Shacknews](https://opencritic.com/outlet/62/shacknews)** - [TJ Denzer](https://opencritic.com/critic/331/tj-denzer) - [9 / 10](https://www.shacknews.com/article/136241/jagged-alliance-3-review-score)

>I had my doubts about if Jagged Alliance 3 could really tap the joy I felt in commanding mercenaries back in Jagged Alliance 2. This is a series that predates most tactical strategy we know, but it’s had some bumps along the road. Jagged Alliance 3 can’t be counted among those bumps. It’s a proficient and beautiful return to form for this franchise with a wealth of options inside and outside combat. It’s also a tough game to overcome, but with all of the options at your disposal, finding your path through the breathtaking landscapes of Grand Chien should be an exciting and varied blast every time. I’ll have a hard time putting anything else in the strategy category above this when the year ends.

**[Try Hard Guides](https://opencritic.com/outlet/855/try-hard-guides)** - [Erik Hodges](https://opencritic.com/critic/9148/erik-hodges) - [9 / 10](https://tryhardguides.com/jagged-alliance-3-review/)

>Jagged Alliance 3 takes a familiar yet improved-upon turn-based experience, a unique resource management system, 4x-Lite strategy and a satirical setting bursting with character and tosses them all together. While the turn-based combat isn’t going to be everyone’s favorite aspect of the game, it is easy to say that Jagged Alliance 3 hits way more than it misses and offers plenty more for players to enjoy.

-------------

**[The Games Machine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/497/the-games-machine)** - Emanuele Feronato - *Italian* - [8.9 / 10](https://www.thegamesmachine.it/jagged-alliance-3-pc/jagged-alliance-3-recensione-tgm/)

>Jagged Alliance 3 represents the comeback in a big way of turn-based combat strategy games, and it is so compelling that it may revive a genre lately dedicated only to a few hardcore fans. The reckless choice of not showing the probability of hitting turns out to be successful, as it makes each firefight unpredictable, forcing us to risk it all on several occasions. The only flaw in this excellent production is the artificial intelligence of the enemies, who sometimes spare us with no reason or seem prone to suicide. Anyway, it still remains a must have.

**[Wccftech](https://opencritic.com/outlet/304/wccftech)** - [Chris Wray](https://opencritic.com/critic/1264/chris-wray) - [8.5 / 10](https://wccftech.com/review/jagged-alliance-3-unexpendables/)

>Jagged Alliance 3 marks a long-awaited triumphant return for the franchise, with the last undeniably great release being Jagged Alliance 2 over twenty years ago. Creating an exceptional balance on both a strategic and tactical level, bringing back character attributes and progression, an entire inventory system, perks and more, forcing you to balance your broader economy and ensuring you can't just sit back - Haemimont Games have successfully created a game that will challenge, that I have found compelling and fun, and one that has kept me hooked into a ""just one more day"" loop and a few very late nights at that.

>There's a few bolts that could be tightened up here and there, but Jagged Alliance is back in business.

**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - [Shunal Doke](https://opencritic.com/critic/9332/shunal-doke) - [8 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/jagged-alliance-3-review-get-to-the-choppa)

>Jagged Alliance 3 successfully taps into everything that made the franchise great to begin with, giving us a unique blend of genres that mixes turn-based tactical gameplay with some light RPG elements.

-------------

**[CGMagazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/82/cgmagazine)** - [Justin Wood](https://opencritic.com/critic/8041/justin-wood) - [8 / 10](https://www.cgmagonline.com/review/game/jagged-alliance-3-pc-review/)

>For the hardcore turn-based tactics fans, Jagged Alliance 3 takes the series in a great direction. Unfortunately, there is really no onboarding before the difficulty takes a steep leap.

-------------

**[God is a Geek](https://opencritic.com/outlet/111/god-is-a-geek)** - [Mick Fraser](https://opencritic.com/critic/572/mick-fraser) - [8 / 10](https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/jagged-alliance-3-review/)

>There's a lot to like in Jagged Alliance 3. The merc management system is solid, the gear works well, and combat can be very satisfying.

-------------

**[GameGrin](https://opencritic.com/outlet/436/gamegrin)** - [Conor McGuigan](https://opencritic.com/critic/9924/conor-mcguigan) - [6.5 / 10](https://www.gamegrin.com/reviews/jagged-alliance-3-review/)

>Jagged Alliance 3 is a bold attempt at blending the best of multiple genres. Despite success in several areas, its overbearing systems often sideline the enjoyment of an otherwise well-made game.

-------------

**[Rock, Paper, Shotgun](https://opencritic.com/outlet/270/rock-paper-shotgun)** - [Sin Vega](https://opencritic.com/critic/2091/sin-vega) - [Unscored](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jagged-alliance-3-review)

>UI niggles and a wincingly unfunny tone can't sink a strong hybrid of old and new design ideas.

I believe this news is shocking for all of us, users, developers, anyone that had anything to do with ILLUSION or any of its software, I know a few developers, for example, that use ""Honey Select"" to create characters for their games, users who loved the way ""Koikatsu"" allowed you to express anything with its infinite cards and possibilities, and so on...

Why did the Assassin's Creed competitive multiplayer mode vanish and never get a spiritual successor?,5,14z67wp,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/14z67wp/why_did_the_assassins_creed_competitive/,21,"For those who don't know, from Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood to Assassin's Creed Black Flag, AC games have had a competitive multiplayer mode. This mode was as far as I'm aware decently popular while it was running and I've seldom seen anything like it since.


Whereas a lot of competitive gaming these days requires extreme precision and twitch reflexes - from team shooters to CoD to MOBAs - AC was a bit more of a thinking and planning game. You'd choose one of a selection of characters, pick a loadout of traps and buffs, then load onto a small map with a few other players. Each map will have NPC's wandering around doing things robotically and their appearances are strictly clones of the characters the players have chosen. At first you are given one other player to locate and assassinate and are given a radar to hone in on their location. Another player is also assigned *you* as a target and you have to hide from them and evade them if discovered. You know what direction your target is in until you get close, at which point you have to carefully observe the area for where your target is hiding. If you attack a civilian instead of your target, you're stunned and vulnerable to your pursuer and your target has plenty of time to run off and hide again.


It's not a matter of just surviving until the end. You get points for every kill - more points if you pulled off a more difficult and precise kill - and the more points you have, the more players you will get pursuing you at the same time. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins, even if they died a lot. To vary up the gameplay, you have abilities on cooldowns that can do things like turn NPC's around you into clones of yourself or throw down smoke bombs to escape or throw knives to stun people running from you.



The mode was beefy with plenty of fun skins and more stylish assassinations to unlock through play. And, more importantly to me, it felt *unique.* At any given moment you had a target who was hiding from you and you felt the pressure to get to them and off them quickly without them seeing you. At the same time, while you're trying to get close, a pursuer is on your tail knowing your relative position and looking out for any suspicious behavior from the NPC's. So you'd feel pressure to hurry and race across the rooftops to your quarry but if you do that then your pursuer will know exactly where you are and catch you before you have the chance to make your kill. And if you make your kill, you then need to run away and resume cover - at times, not even knowing if your pursuer has seen you or not.


There was so many overlapping tensions in this gameplay loop. You'll swap between moving stealthily, hunting, chasing, escaping, hiding, resuming stealth. And you're not working against easily predicted sight cones attached to robots. Your job is to *fool other humans.* There is quite a bit of this DNA in Among Us, even, though it's obviously not the same.



I also recall this mode being critically loved and active right up to the release of the next AC game and sometimes beyond. As I get older, I find I just can't keep up in competitive multiplayer against teenagers who can react to things in a fraction of the time that I can. So why has this mode not left a bigger impression? Why has Ubisoft cut this and never replaced it? Why didn't they spin it off into another series despite churning out heaps of AC content every year? And why (unless I'm mistaken?) has no one attempted to fill the void and replicate this mode?


Am I alone in this mode having left such a big impression on me almost ten years since the last time it was in a game?",1689308740.0

Scaling Enemies makes leveling systems and side quests partially redundant redundant,2,14z6g3e,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/14z6g3e/scaling_enemies_makes_leveling_systems_and_side/,55,"Currently playing Diablo IV. I have noticed this trend in modern RPGs where alot of them employ scaling enemies either their scaling is reduced such as in FFXVI where they are a few levels behind you or such as in the case of Diablo IV where enemies scale along with the MC. 

To me this is a completely redundant idea. This is for a few reasons: 

1. It takes away from any feeling of progression. Sure the numbers are going up but if the enemies are scaling along with you then grinding away to progress your character feels lack luster. Players no longer get the feeling of their character actually progressing besides watching numbers go up and unlocking new abilities to play with. 

2. Leveling up in my view serves two purposes it is to again give the feeling of building your character and also to gate keep content of the game so that players do not feel overwhelmed. Scaling enemies takes away from the first purpose. 

3. Side quests also serve two purposes. Leveling up stats and world building. Again by implementing scaling enemies game devs make the entire leveling up of stats redundant because enemies scale with you. 

This is a summarized and simplified version of my view. While I understand that devs also have to keep the game challenging to keep players engaged. But scaling enemies is a lazy concept that serves as a quick work around but overall takes away from the quality of the game. 

Assigning level zones to sections of the map is a better solution to the issue imo. For example you can divide your map into four sections A B C D. 

Zone A is Level 1 - 10

Zone B is level 10 - 20

And so on. 

Before anyone points out I know that alot of MMOs already implement this system but it works. 

Cheers!",1689309444.0

>Atelier Marie Remake is a superb update of the original that old and new players of the Atelier series will gladly jump into. The time with Marie may feel short but its replay value makes up for it with so much to do before you turn in your final exam. Start your alchemy studies and jump in!

>A simple but endearing experience, Atelier Marie Remake: The Alchemist of Salburg is a nostalgic adventure that does justice to the satisfying crafting mechanics that have represented the series' identity for nearly a quarter of a century. While it might lack the complexity and depth of more recent entries, and some of its ""classic"" elements feel a little dated, it provides a solid core gameplay loop within a charming package. It's a bite-sized nostalgic RPG romp that feels cosy as heck and never outstays its welcome.

>Atelier Marie Remake: Alchemist of Salzburg is the remake of the first game in the Atelier saga. A tactical RPG that started the bases of the alchemy of the saga with a simple but effective story, which has been maintained for this re-delivery. Graphically it's a chibi game that looks pretty good, except for some blur problems in the frames and with a really nice soundtrack.

>Atelier Marie Remake: The Alchemist of Salburg is a really cute and simple game. Simply cute! The art, music, and neat characters warm my heart with the essence of the good 'ol days of interestingly fresh RPGs. The game's strengths come from the interweaving of simple mechanics and ideas, while the cracks begin to show when said simplicities are individually scrutinized. This remake is a splendid time if it meets your expectations of a simple and quaint time, but can leave those looking for a richer experience yearning for more.

>Atelier Marie Remake: The Alchemist of Salburg is a charming game with a delightfully simple premise. Though the game suffers from some finicky controls and a lack of complexity, the world and characters make up for many accidentally skipped cutscenes or days!

>Nowadays, we are used to the grand adventures of Ryza and company, and you can’t escape the fact that Atelier Marie is a more basic game. It focuses less on battles and exploration, and there might come a point in those five years of gameplay when you really miss new things to explore or items to make. What makes this game worth playing? Managing time and money, setting your Fairies to work as efficiently as possible and working with friends. It’s the events that add colour to the storyline and will keep you engaged to meet as many of the criteria as you can.
>
>Gust did a great job bringing us the Atelier Marie Remake. It gives new life to a 26-year-old title, bringing a new kind of gameplay to the table for gamers used to the later Atelier games.

>Atelier Marie Remake: The Alchemist of Salburg is an impressively well-realized revisit to a long-lost RPG classic. What it lacks in length or complexity, it makes up for in charm and quality; this is the kind of game that you can get sucked into for an hour or two at a time without even realizing it. Its laid-back atmosphere, open-ended gameplay, and lovely visuals all combine to make this a must-buy for fans of the series, and a highly recommended title for those who want to see what Atelier is all about.

>Arland, Dusk, Mysterious, Ryza/Secret) is self-contained, so it's not necessary to play Marie before those other games. However, for fans of the series it's fun to see where it all started and how much Gust got right from the start, considering this is still a very fun, breezy JRPG to play. It makes me hope that other games in the series can be brought to modern platforms and that the Atelier series can continue to thrive!.

>Atelier Marie Remake: The Alchemist of Salburg is a fun if simple title. Despite major differences, I can see how it led to titles such as Atelier Ryza, Ayesha, or Sophie. 
>
>The remake has done a great job of bringing it to modern audiences, but it still shows its age. Taking it for what it is though, a look back at the origins and initially a PlayStation 1 title, there's still a lot of enjoyment to be had. Just don't expect an epic JRPG tale where you save the world here. You are but a simple alchemist, helping her friends and the townspeople.

>Atelier Marie Remake: The Alchemist of Salburg is an exciting re-release of the first game of a RPG series that demonstrates that shows for both new and old fans that many of the elements that captivated them were present from the very beginning. Despite being limited by all its simplicity, the title is a lot of fun during its relatively short length.

>Atelier Marie Remake: The Alchemist of Salburg is a nice Remke that allows you to experience where the franchise began. Though the game is constant timing you on everything you do the time to prepare for whatever tasks ahead can lead to some great discoveries. With great visuals and entertain and simple combat there should be plenty for fans to enjoy and for new comers to discover.

>Atelier Marie Remake is simultaneously a return to form and a fresh step forward for the Atelier series. It's incredible to experience the roots of this series, and as sad as I am about the barebones storytelling, the shifted focus to time-management and calendar events gives the game an addictive farm-simulator vibe that kept me glued to it for hours. I'm excited to see how ideas from this remake come forward to inspire whatever this series has in store for us next.

>If you value an exceptionally well-crafted story that rivals the depth of a compelling novel and are willing to approach Oxenfree II: Lost Signals with an open mind, setting aside conventional expectations of a typical video game, then this game comes highly recommended. Its strengths lie in its storytelling prowess, making it a worthwhile experience for those seeking a captivating narrative.

>Oxenfree II: Lost Signals' story is moving, moody, and meticulously crafted in line with your choices. Immersive in every way, the gameplay is deeply tied to the game's narrative, never feeling disjointed even as you move from chasing frequencies to traversing the land, and all of that succeeds because of how you, as Riley, fit into the story.

-------------

**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Recommended](https://www.consolecreatures.com/review-oxenfree-ii-lost-signals/)

>With some of the best writing, voice acting, supernatural set pieces, and atmospheric settings ever, Oxenfree II: Lost Signals is a must-play game. It was worth the wait, and if you're a fan of thrillers or sci-fi, this is a no-brainer.

>Oxenfree II: Lost Signals is another narrative hit for Night School, delivering a slow-burn story that expertly weaves together supernatural horror with an introspective story of self-discovery. The sequel does find itself struggling with its own identity crisis though, as tedious interactivity leaves me wondering if the studio’s heart is more in movies or TV than video games.

>Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals is a fascinating follow-up that smartly continues adventures in a world we know and love, while adding in exciting twists and turns that tie up loose ends from the first game and expand it convincingly. Some minor technical issues and narrative speedbumps aside, there’s clever new mechanics and a bigger, richer game to explore that makes for one of the most satisfying stories this year.

>However, a few technical issues and new-generation oversights keep Oxenfree II from being a game that truly stands out from the crowd, which is disappointing given the rest of its potential.

>Oxenfree II doesn’t shake up what its predecessor did in 2016, but it delivers more of the excellent writing and charm I expect from Night School Studio. While it's light on gameplay beyond traversal, it’s done in service of the characters. After 10 hours with this cast, I want more, but I’m happy with where this story ends and how my choices shaped that ending. Despite bad checkpointing and a swift rush to the end after an overly long setup, this return feels earned and essential, with a message that resonates far more than Oxenfree's. With Oxenfree II behind me, I’m thrilled Night School Studio delivered something special more than seven years away from this world.

>For only being a four-hour-long game Oxenfree II: Lost Signals has a lot to say. A narrative that is more intricate than its predecessor, while still holding onto the framework that made Oxenfree stand out. Lost Signals makes you care about these people. The voice acting goes above and beyond to help drive that home. Like the first title, Lost Signals feels unique in the video game space. With a few minor hiccups, and one upsetting one, Oxenfree II: Lost Signals is, without hesitation, worth a second and third playthrough.

>You can roll credits on Oxenfree 2 in 4-5 hours, but every minute of that brief runtime makes a lasting impression. It spins a captivating tale that masterfully balances its horror elements against the story's more intimate side, and combines that with a simple yet engaging gameplay loop, with an excellent dialogue system serving as the centerpiece. The end result is a short yet memorable game that you definitely shouldn't miss out on.

>While Oxenfree II: Lost Signals doesn't hit the same heights as the original game, it still delivers another enjoyable adventure, once again serving up another unique ghost story that uses haunted technology to great effect, which succeeds thanks to terrific dialogue and well-crafted characters. Camena may be quite similar to Edwards Island in a lot of ways, but it still plays hosts to a nicely spooky trip more than worth taking, especially for fans of the first title.

>Oxenfree II: Lost Signals is an excellent sequel that takes the story in a significantly different direction without losing what made the original such an essential piece of storytelling. The sharper focus on fewer characters makes for a much better-paced experience without the need to juggle multiple relationships. Pacing issues do crop up if you happen to take a wrong turn but, in spite of that, Oxenfree II still provides an intriguing, suspenseful mystery that fans and newcomers will both adore. Be sure to play the original first, though.

>Luckily the game is constantly auto saving so no progress was lost, but any crash is still frustrating nonetheless. Getting past those though, I found this second entry into the story of Edwards Island to be worthwhile. The world feels dark and mysterious, the voice actors are all killing their roles, and for those who have played the original game you will probably walk away feeling satisfied with at least one of the possible endings the game offers, I know I was.

>Oxenfree II: Lost Signals may not be the most ambitious sequel, but it is certainly a great one.

>In the end, I loved the idea of Oxenfree 2 more than the game itself. It’s a game that has the right pieces, but falls short of putting them together in a way that lives up to the innovative, classic experience of the original game. A more compelling story is frustratingly hidden within the game’s branching narrative system, and it’s a shame that some people will miss it.

>Oxenfree II: Lost Signals is a fairly safe sequel that allows its narrative and new cast of characters to do the heavy lifting. Through constant chit-chat between Riley and Jacob, gameplay remains enjoyable enough to keep you engaged, allowing the story to always be at the forefront of your mind.

>Night School's writing can't be praised enough, because the team is able to be whatever it needs to be in the moment. It can be a supernatural thriller when the time calls for it. It can be a coming-of-age tale when the moment is right. It can go from buddy comedy to buddy drama in an instant. All of it works, and it's a credit to the writers and the voice actors. Oxenfree 2's story will put players through the emotional wringer, but it's a ride that's worth taking.

>Oxenfree II: Lost Signals is a fantastic follow-up to an excellent game that's sure to please fans of the first. Riley is a relatable protagonist, the writing is strong and the dial on the horror factor has been turned up to 11. The only thing missing is a quick travel option.

>Oxenfree II: Lost Signals is a great second season that makes the already beautiful Oxenfree feel like a pilot episode. An intense, exciting and playfully aware narrative adventure, capable of perfectly integrating gameplay with writing. Artistically remarkable, thematically profound, full of tense situations, where to make decisions and direct the fate of our protagonists, playing the part that seems most suitable to us, without the story ever lacking in coherence. If this is what Netflix wants to do with the video game, the future looks rosy for lovers of this genre (success permitting). Radio chills.

>There are so many expectations to live up to after delivering the first Oxenfree, but Oxenfree II charts its own course, delivering something unlike Night School Studio's previous games. It has sharper horror, more inventive storytelling, and a variety of systems to keep you engaged through hours of slow and somber small-town exploration.

>From start to finish Oxenfree II is able to evolve in every aspect from the original. Night School Studio has created another exceptionally spooky story that ends with an even stronger emotional gut punch than the original. The puzzles are fun, if not challenging, and the way the game reacts to players' choices is not only a boon to the story but also seems as if it could encourage several playthroughs without getting stale.

>As a sequel, Oxenfree II: Lost Signals is at least on par with the first title. The game strikes a good balance of platforming and puzzle-solving, while also giving you the freedom to figure out things without much hand-holding. The art style may present small characters, but the graphics still shine, and the music is haunting enough to maintain a feeling of unease throughout the adventure. It is once again the fleshed-out characters, deep narrative, and excellent pacing that will keep you hooked on the game from the opening moments all the way to the end credits. For fans of adventure games, Oxenfree II is a worthy buy, even if you've never played the first title.

Just finished Mortal Shell. A quick review.,52,14xfwsu,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/14xfwsu/just_finished_mortal_shell_a_quick_review/,54,"I want to get my thoughts down while the game is completely fresh in my mind. Don't know if anyone will read or care but here are my thoughts, WITH SPOILERS, for Mortal Shell: 

The game feels extremely similar to Lords of the Fallen in terms of how heavy and clunky it feels. While the core game is promising, it becomes very dull very quickly when you realize the best way to handle every enemy and every encounter is the same, learn when the big openings are, hit once, back out again. The ""core"" innovative mechanic, hardening, seems to be intended to add an easy way out, as if for people who got tired of Dark Souls' incredibly punishing nature. In Mortal Shell, if you mess up an attack window, you can just harden, and almost always avoid damage. Like a mulligan almost whenever you want it. 

I'll go in order of what I thought was best and worst. The core gameplay is pretty fun. It's severely lacking, though, in enough variety. Once you get used to your favorite shell (character) and weapon, you can optimize a simple ideal strategy against almost every enemy, almost immediately. I played as the tank using a big two-hander sword, and the strategy for 100% of the game was dodge, leaping attack, regain stamina, repeat. Harden if you mess up. The boss fights go on for kind of a long time (although I did them out of order), and two of them, the ice boss and the final boss, were mind-numbingly dull because it was just repeating this pattern for 20 minutes each. And finally, not going to drone on about it, but devs, seriously, gank encounters. Bad. Stop it. Bear traps everywhere, and baddies hiding behind walls everywhere, is bad. Looking at you too, Fromsoft. 

The bosses are pretty good. I'd say they are on the middle-low quality of fromsoft bosses, fairly enjoyable. My biggest gripe was how tanky they were, although I did the dungeons out of order so kind of my fault. Final boss was still considerably too tanky, though, and that can't be on me as I was maxed out and it was the final boss. 

The level design is sub-par. It's not *bad*, the oppressive atmosphere is good, the aesthetics and layout aren't *bad*, but they are **very** confusing and maze-like, made far worse by everything looking the same everywhere. In a game that emphasizes having different shells and weapons, the confusing level design is a pretty major detriment. If you could more rapidly swap shells and weapons, it could be a more interesting game, but there's extremely few items that swap your shell/weapon, and running all the way back to the main hub to do it is too cumbersome due to the confusing design and distance you'd have to travel. I ended up just rolling with one character, one weapon, from pretty much start to finish. 

The story is BAD. Nonexistent, as far as I could tell. It's got some vague *everything sucks and everything is a curse and hehehe you're doomed* vibe to it, but no actual story to be seen. For me, this is a big deal, if there's no story there's no immersion, and without immersion why bother. Really disappointing here. The final boss is also pretty stupidly foreshadowed. Oh, just give these divine items to the massive chained prisoner who gives you magical powers in exchange for the divine items, wonder if he's going to obviously betray you at the end. Also, I don't appreciate the final boss being a elden-ring style water boss that keeps running away from you. PTSD flashbacks from elden ring. 

Overall, I think it's very similar to Lords of the Fallen (which might put me in the minority of reviews) -- a very solid souls-like game that's worth playing, but falls well short of what it could be. Clunkiness I understand can be unavoidable due to budget constraints, but seriously devs, please put at least some effort into a coherent story to carry the game. Having no story whatsoever is unacceptable. 

Clunky, lacking, but fun for a short romp. I'd say very worth giving a shot / 10.",1689142513.0

What’s your threshold for suffering at the hands of truly poor gameplay to experience a great story?,252,14v8t6j,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/14v8t6j/whats_your_threshold_for_suffering_at_the_hands/,472,"I’m finishing Alan Wake Remastered in anticipation of Alan Wake II, as I’m a big Remedy fan, and this has to be one of the most frustrating, poorly controlling and least fun gaming experiences I’ve ever had. I know it’s an old game, but man, thank goodness gameplay has evolved. 

Combat encounters are so cheap and nearly all of my deaths are getting ambush swarmed by spongy enemies. In most cases it’s nearly impossible to avoid getting hit and taking significant damage and when the point flashlight then shoot once their barrier breaks formula doesn’t work, you’re just leaving a trail of flares to try and escape. It also doesn’t help that Alan has an absolutely minuscule amount of running stamina and the camera angle is glued to his shoulder. The dodging mechanic is also tied to the same button as sprint and is regulated with stamina as well. The camera also insists on reverting back to the left shoulder view, and as a right-handed individual, this makes for a disorienting experience. 

I’m absolutely hooked on the story though. It’s a little cheesy and has that old, episodic DVD style, some of the voice acting is truly bad, (especially the FBI agent who continually calls you by different famous author names) but the overall plot is engaging. It’s also been fun to see the beginnings/parallels to Control, one of my all-time favorites, as we now know both games are in the same universe.

I'm Dan, and I'm creating **Parcel Simulator** \- a parcel inspection and sorting facility simulator. Parcel Simulator has you take charge of a parcel sorting facility, with a split focus on inspecting parcels for labelling issues and contraband, as well as automating your warehouse with conveyors and other cool kit.

Parcel Simulator will feature a bunch of different types of parcel inspections - from **checking labels for issues** with addresses, serial numbers, and a bunch of other content, to **checking the physical content**s of packages against **declaration forms** and for **contraband items**.

You'll also be able to **build** and **upgrade** your **parcel sorting facility**. Purchase conveyor belts and automated sorting machines so you can automate the otherwise-laborious inspections that you'll become accustomed to, and customise the layout and feel of your warehouse to be exactly how you want it.

I'm a big Papers Please fan, and this was the initial inspiration for the meticulous label inspections in, what was originally a passion-project, Parcel Simulator. Since then, it's flourished into a much more feature-rich sim game, and I'm hoping to get it released by the end of the year! We'll see how that goes though, as I'm also working full-time as a software engineer when I'm not working on this project. Updates on development can be found in all the links below.

FACEMINER - Wristwork - A Biometric Data Harvesting & AI Training Management Sim (Set in 1999),39,14v0kof,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/14v0kof/faceminer_wristwork_a_biometric_data_harvesting/,7,"[Steam Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2276980/FACEMINER/)

Hi! Still pinning down exactly how to talk about this slightly bizarre game I have been working on, but here it goes:  
FACEMINER is an experimental, narrative-driven management sim where you build a biometric processing empire from scratch. You must classify dubiously sourced biometric data, upgrade mining infrastructure, and scale up your AI surveillance empire to obscene ends in this hardcore thriller clicker that may or may not be a critique of planetary-scale data harvesting and AI training operations.

The trailer [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgsHnT7xZ-s) probably gives a better idea than words can, but for a basic overview of what playing it is like:

&#x200B;

* Detailed simulation of data centre operations; manage RAM, processing power, memory, cooling systems, software upgrades and more.
* Keep track of the office gossip — and reveal the story of FACEMINER — through the lively internal messaging system.
* Visualise your data center in 3D with the state-of-the-art (for 1999) ‘Visualiser’ tool.
* Set within a painstakingly crafted tribute to everybody’s favourite vintage operating system.
* Soundtrack comprised of true-to-period MIDI, dug up and restored from the deepest recesses of the internet.

The game is not yet released (thinking Q4 this year or Q1 of next year, to get it in really good shape before doing so), but a playable demo is coming very soon.

If you haven’t heard of SENTRY before, we’re an action tower-defense game where you defend spaceships from aliens. You get to do cool stuff like slam blast doors shut (which the aliens will cut through) and vent baddies out into space! We've also got a dynamic campaign, something we'll be showing soon. Here’s a trailer that shows some of the action: [https://youtu.be/J8q\_sIs-irY](https://youtu.be/J8q_sIs-irY)

# About the game

The core idea is that you can **redefine how each weapon works** by attaching weapon mods to them. You **build up a squad of holographic soldiers** and military drones, give them weapons with unique modifier-combinations, and slay a horde of futuristic bots.

I hope it's apparent from the Steam page that I was inspired by games like Soulstone Survivors and 20 Minutes Till Dawn, (I love finding those ""game-breaking"" upgrade synergies so much), and I wanted to make a similar one, but with my own spin on the genre.

# Progress update

So I've been getting some awesome feedback (both from Reddit and other places), and have been implementing a bunch of changes based on that, so if you've played the game previously, I think it's well worth checking it out again now.

Also, I took part in Steam Next Fest, which I celebrated with a big update (and some smaller ones since the fest as well). I owe a huge ""thank you"" to everyone who shared their thoughts! I can't stress this enough, this stuff is invaluable for a solo dev like me.

# Future stuff

A couple months back I decided to skip Early Access for the game. Instead, I'll be doing a closed beta nearing launch, and I'll release it into 1.0 later this year. Some content that was originally planned for the Early Access version will be added to the free demo.

So a lot of stuff is coming, if you have any suggestions, feel free to comment here or on Steam, or Discord, or anywhere really.

Happy slaying!",1688908633.0
Oppidum - EP Games - Co-op adventure inspired by Breath of the Wild combat and Stardew Valley resource management,13,14v3x68,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/14v3x68/oppidum_ep_games_coop_adventure_inspired_by/,12,"Hello, good people at r/Games, and happy Indie Sunday to all of you!Today I'd like to bring Oppidum to your attention, a game our team has been developing for a few months, which has been brewing inside our minds for quite some time.

&#x200B;

Oppidum is an cooperative multiplayer adventure set on the magical island of Insule. Don't be too fooled by its vibrant colours, though, as the island is full of dangers and challenges. While we want the game to feel welcoming and inviting, we also try to keep players on their toes while exploring the land.

The game will have a focus on narrative, giving player a clear end goal which they might approach at their own pace, playing according to their own style. Do you want to bash your way through the enemy camps? Sure. Do you want to focus on growing your crops and baking muffins to boost your stats? Just do it. Do you want to assign a different role to each member of the party so everyone can get at what they do best? We got you.

As mentioned the game will have fighting, crafting, farming, cooking, fishing (by popular demand)... all these mechanics put together in order for the player to discover the story of the Oppidum, the secrets of the island, and help the friendly inhabitants of Insule with a threat to their very existence. Here's some early gameplay footage of the game: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=safMVeCzj48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=safMVeCzj48)

The game will support cross-platform gameplay at launch, and will be available on PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

If I managed to catch your attention, keep an eye on our [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/PlayOppidum)! Will be sharing progress in development on there.

I'll also let everyone know soon about the Discord server, for anyone who'd like to join and follow the development more closely.

Thank you for the opportunity! I'm super excited to announce the release date for my second game 'VIDEOVERSE' with this [new trailer](https://youtu.be/L3k_0_KQcDQ)! It will launch on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2079180/VIDEOVERSE/) and [itch.io](https://kinmoku.itch.io/videoverse) on **Monday 7th August 2023**, alongside Steam Visual Novel Fest with a 10% launch discount.

Like my first game (One Night Stand), it's a decision-based narrative adventure, focusing on character development and friendship. VIDEOVERSE sends players back in time to a fictional video game era, where players can foster friendships, share fan art and browse the lively gaming communities. It's been inspired by Miiverse, MSN messenger and old school message boards.

The retro soundtrack was composed by Clark Aboud (Slay the Spire, Kind Words) and narration is by Mark Takeshi Ota (LIVE A LIVE, The Great Ace Attorney).

Last week, VIDEOVERSE won the Critics’ Choice Award at [Indie Cup UK 23](https://twitter.com/gtpindiecup/status/1673727710777024513), and jurors praised its “*atmosphere, attention to detail and brilliant narrative*”. The demo was also recommended recently by [Kotaku](https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-iv-street-fighter-6-final-fantasy-15-xvi-1850549073/slides/6) and [Rock Paper Shotgun](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/videoverses-first-chapter-is-the-perfect-portrait-of-early-internet-fan-forums), and is still available to play on Steam until launch.

I always loved managerial/simulation like games and I always loved chess. It didn't take a lot for me to start developing this idea of chess manager game. 

At first I wanted to focus only on managerial aspects and leave the match simulation to AI but through iterations and feedback I ended up with some kind of hybrid where you play the matches but your character is there to guide and help you. 

Over time, your character improves (and maybe your chess skills too!), goes further and further in his career, plays more prestigious tournaments, gets chess titles and even becomes World Chess Champion!

There's a free demo on my itch.io channel: [https://branegames.itch.io/master-of-chess](https://branegames.itch.io/master-of-chess) and I hope to get a Steam demo by the end of July. I'd like to release the full game in October but I've got no real idea when the game will be done

"Spirit Interlude - Boing Boing Games - Ghibli themed Autobattler Roguelite focusing on characters with simple yet extremely varied (and sometimes goofy) abilities, leading to loads of builds and playstyles",6,14uydpa,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/14uydpa/spirit_interlude_boing_boing_games_ghibli_themed/,12,"[**Steam page**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2243070/Spirit_Interlude/) **|**  [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/pG5B4Wp5yK) **|** [**Trailer**](https://youtu.be/S2RKfkYP95E)

Hey r/Games! We are a 2 people team working on Spirit Interlude from Bali. If you like Slay the Spire / Teamfight Tactics this game could be for you!

Spirit Interlude is an Autobattler Roguelite with a bunch of unique looking characters inspired by **Ghibli movies creatures**. These so called ""Spirits"" have straightforward but very diverse and sometimes **goofy** **abilities**, leading to loads of **unique builds and playstyles**. Collect then build your team of Spirits and find new exciting **synergies to try every run**!

&#x200B;

**Detailed explanation below, but the trailer on the Steam page should be enough for you to get the gist of it.**

# The game

Each run you start with the default set of characters in your team. After a few runs you will unlock the possibility to replace some of these default characters by those in your collection (Meta Progression). In the around 45 minutes of a run you will get to **add new characters to your team and customize your build**. The battles you take and your build customization (Droprate modification, Board space improvements...) will depend on the paths you choose.

**Each Battle plays similar to an Autochess/TFT game**, with an average of 10 rounds (5-10mins) to win. It's like a regular (but singleplayer) Autochess game with similar unit upgrades and reroll systems. But instead of drawing from the total pool of characters you will **only draw** \*\*from the pool of characters in your team/deck (Slay The Spire like).

There is however an unique ""Double Battlefield"" board setup that will spice things up. This **Double Battlefield will split your board between an attack and a defense squad** before each fight, same for your AI opponent. Each battle will be fought on two fronts simultaneously. Splitting your units to effectively attack and defense at the same time is key.

But the core of the game lies in the straightforward yet extremely diverse abilities of the characters. Where almost each unit has one simple but impactful ability. **With 50+ unique characters**, including fusion between some units that unlock game changing abilities. The Double Battlefield setup makes it possible to have a lot of very powerful abilities that would be impossible to balance in a regular Autobattler. Combine this with path driven build customization and you get exciting **new synergies, combos and playstyles each run**!

&#x200B;

# Why make this game

**Unexpected, goofy looking and unique combinations** are what I'm always trying to do when playing TFT. Spirit Interlude is simply about that, about being able to make these kinds of combinations in an autobattler each run.

But it's also about keeping character complexity to a minimum. In many team crafting games you need to account for armor, magic resist, critical chance... and characters with super complex ""gain 3% magicpoisonwater if X makes two spins on a full moon three times a turn"" type of stuff. Spirit Interlude takes the same philsophy Marvel Snap does to describe their card: ""3 small lines of text max to describe a card"". With this philosophy comes **straightforward and easy to grasp abilities, while retaining very diverse synergies and playstyles.**

Also, Ghibli, good movies, much bestiary, nice stuff.

&#x200B;

# Features

* **Autochess** team building: **Collect, place and upgrade Spirits** to build a powerful team. Spirits have 3 levels (1,2 then 3 Stars). Many Spirits also have a last level making them fuse with one another to create a Mega Spirit.
* **Ghibly inspired** creatures: **50+** Unique looking **characters with** **handmade animations** giving each one its own personality.
* **Double battlefield**: Teams are separated into an attack and a defense squad for each battle. Mindful team management is required to attack effectively while leaving enough defenses to survive.
* Unique and sometimes **goofy abilities**: Most Spirits have one **straightforward but impactful** ability. Mega Spirits have game changing abilities.
* Combos: Impactful and diverse abilities lead to many **many synergies and counters**.
* **Scaling difficulty**: Unlock new difficulties upon run completion. The first difficulty is suitable for anyone.
* Playstyle defining paths: The **paths** you choose bring further **customization (modify drop rates, add positioning options...)** and will lead to an unique build each run.
* **Peaceful strategy**: The calm of a lunar illuminated woodland is perfect to relax and strategize.

&#x200B;

# Our journey

This part is mainly about sharing the different steps, iterations, inspirations and choices behind the game.

The main inspiration came from TFT (surprisingly). But also from the tower defense Rogue Tower at the beginning. From this combinations came the ""Double Battlefield"" idea for an autobattler. And the first step was completing a [prototype that you can check out on itchio](https://digidig.itch.io/attack-defense-autobattler).

When the prototype seemed to work (around october of last year), I brought along my partner and we came up together with the game's ""Ghibli inspired"" spirit theme. We first tried for an ""hyper realistic visuals"" version of a forest enabled by the new features of Unreal Engine 5. But the tech is currently a bit too complicated and time consuming to work with for indies, so we turned back to a more anime/ghibli style.

For the characters we got the idea to make them 2D spirits early on ([see this moodboard](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y1ponJyhT3NvcAvH1dQSLruLgbnV5ane/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112220086505293761664&rtpof=true&sd=true) we made) but the challenge was to find a compromise between readability and feasability. We wanted characters with handmade animations to convey personality to each spirit. But 50+ characters to design and animate is a lot of work. So we tried to make each spirit as simple but distinct from the others as possible.

From this came a first Demo about 6 months ago. At this point the game was too slow and too complex without a lot of replayability. So these last 6 months we made the remaining characters but more importantly we took the Roguelike Deckbuilder path that immensely improved the replayability. And today we have a public Playtest for you to try the game!

There's Always a Madman - Sunny Demeanor Games - A spy thriller interactive novel that's Mission Impossible meets James Bond (NEW GAME ANNOUNCEMENT with free demo available now),4,14uxys1,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/14uxys1/theres_always_a_madman_sunny_demeanor_games_a_spy/,2,"Excited for the new Mission: Impossible film coming out in a few days on 7/12?  Then I've got just the game for you!  It's a spy thriller interactive novel called [There's Always a Madman: Fight or Flight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2390500/Theres_Always_a_Madman_Fight_or_Flight), and there's a **free demo available on Steam right now**: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2390500/Theres\_Always\_a\_Madman\_Fight\_or\_Flight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2390500/Theres_Always_a_Madman_Fight_or_Flight)

Hi - my name is Adam, and I'm a solo developer working on my next game: the spy thriller ***There's Always a Madman: Fight or Flight***.

# About ""There's Always a Madman: Fight or Flight""

***There’s Always a Madman: Fight or Flight*** is a single-player spy thriller interactive novel where you step into the shoes of the suave secret agent Franklin Benjamin.  That means driving fast cars, seducing beautiful women, and doing whatever it takes to save the day against impossible odds.  **Because there's always a madman, and you're the best agent we've got!**

**The game will release in Q1 2024**, but **there's a free demo you can play on Steam** ***right now*** right [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2390500/Theres_Always_a_Madman_Fight_or_Flight)!

# Why make this game

I believe **there are not enough great** ***spy*** **video games out there**.  Sure, there are plenty of games where you shoot 100 enemies each level and do a few spy things along the way, but I want to make a true **spy** game - a game where **the main character carries a gun and is empowered to kill when necessary but largely uses their wit to get out of a sticky situation**.  In other words, a game where you’re not lining up headshots but instead deciding whether to fight vs. run, to trust a companion vs. go it alone, to make a quip vs. stay on high alert, etc.

With this in mind, **I feel there’s a place for a spy thriller game that plays more like a visual novel than a standard shooter** (i.e. it relies on careful consideration of options presented to succeed in your mission rather than on quick-trigger reflexes to mow down everyone in your path).  Surely there is great enjoyment in stepping into the shoes of a secret agent and seeing if you have the intelligence and wherewithal to accomplish the mission, save the day, and perhaps even get the girl.

The game is **text-based**.  This is because James Bond, Jason Bourne, Jack Reacher, and Jack Ryan all started off in text format with novels.  And as they say, **the book is always better**, so I think a more book-like experience works for this game.  That said, although the game is text-based like a novel, an emphasis is placed on visuals and music to set the appropriate mood for each scene, changing based on whether you're in a safe location or you're exposed to danger

# Similar games for reference

For reference, here are some similar games to help you get a further sense for what ***There's Always A Madman*** is like: GoldenEye 007 (and other James Bond games like Everything or Nothing), Mission: Impossible, Alpha Protocol, Hitman games, Splinter Cell games, Henchman Story, Agent A: A Puzzle in Disguise, Framed, I Expect You To Die, Batman Telltale Series, The Wolf Among Us, Agent 64: Spies Never Die

It also draws inspiration from non-video game sources such as: James Bond, Mission: Impossible, 24, Get Smart, Austin Powers, Archer, Jack Ryan, Jack Reacher, the “Threat Level Midnight” episode of The Office, and the “You Only Move Twice” episode of The Simpsons.

No More Snow - Barzda - Dark Christmas themed linear hordes shooter inspired by Tim Burton's works,4,14v3awa,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/14v3awa/no_more_snow_barzda_dark_christmas_themed_linear/,3,"Hello there!

I'm a solo developer from Lithuania. I'm making a spooky simple low poly top-down shooter. In my game, Santa is trying to save Christmas from his evil nemesis Krampus. Every level has unique enemies (various snowmen, elves, gnomes) and a big boss fight at the end (Snowmen King, Nutcracker, Rudolf and etc).

[Steam Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2244970/No_More_Snow/?utm_source=reddit)

[Game Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMbZvMi-30)

[Gameplay Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0H6vX4xerg)

The game is a linear, contra-like shooter. I tried to make a fun, rage releaser, time-skipper to spend long fall/winter evenings. Or just pump up with some Christmas spirit. I'm also planning to add local co-op mode, so you can blast all snow creatures together with a friend.

Why Christmas? For a long time now, I had a tradition before the winter holidays to make a Christmas game where Santa is fighting evil snowmen. Nightmare Before Christmas and all other Tim Burton films were always my favorite. So inspired by them, I tried to add a  dark twist to happy things. First, it was just simple short flash games. But a few years back I made my first 3D game and uploaded it to itchio. It got quite of success so I decided to expand it and release a full game on Steam.",1688921206.0
Gehinnom – ChaosMinds – Banish Demons From Hell in a multiplayer randomly generated horror game + pvp mode where you are the demon,1,14v2pu7,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/14v2pu7/gehinnom_chaosminds_banish_demons_from_hell_in_a/,0,"Hey r/Games

If you haven't heard of Gehinnom before, it's a project of mine that I've been working on solo for the past two years, and it's very close to launching now.

Basically, in this game, everything is random because I believe true horror lies in the unknown.If you've played horror games before, you know that most of them are like a one-time experience. With this game, I'd like you to have endless replayability.

So, the map, the loot, the objectives, the scares, even the rocks on the road - **everything is random.**

I do keep the game fairly simple and familiar to other games that inspired me, so it's not too overwhelming. Your goal as a player is simple:solve quests -> get clues on how to perform the ritual -> find the ritual spot and banish the demon.But because everyone likes a challenge, we also got the PvP mode that isn't as simple.

One player gets to be a demon, but you start as a ghost. You will have to scare the other players first by manipulating the environment. Only when you successfully scare the other players enough you will get to spawn in your physical form and attack them.I have a more [visualized video on my TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@chaosminds/video/7212652803070643457) explaining how the PVP mode works.

Also, I try to post as many times as I can on my TikTok account, getting viewers' feedback on improving the game. So, following me there is a great way to stay updated on the project.

And you can also check out the Steam page to see more.

Thoughts on Games with Unrelatable Factions?,80,14udfpf,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/14udfpf/thoughts_on_games_with_unrelatable_factions/,157,"I was playing through Pillars of Eternity 2 recently and I hit a point where I just didn't have any urge to play anymore as all of my options lead to me doing things that seemed non-sensical or dumb as all the factions I had were acting insane.

This reminded me of Fallout 4, where your options are genocidal nutjob, confusing nutjobs, bigots, and a guy who wants you to protect a settlement. The latter of which while not super competent without a protagonist around is at least relatable and sane.

This issue seems like it also relates to developers giving you options which are generally nonsensical or terrible for no decent reason like the end of Mass effect 3 where despite significant contrary evidence you're told certain things always happen and so you must make one of several choices all of which are absurdly bad.

It's interesting because clearly developers wanted more grey choices or choices that make you think and it's very possible to do these without causing these problems. Planescape Torment has a number of factions which you can ally with which all have mixed moral philosophies, Fallout NV has questionable choices but even those choices have positives and negatives which are reasonable to them.

You can choose Mr House as he represents a significant return and an end to the old world blues you have even if he's a tyrannical morally questionable dictator. You can choose the NCR even if they're riven with problems and corruption. You can choose yourself even if you may have made a worse choice there. 

Anyone experience the same problems in those games above or have a game that just floored you with how angry the bad end game logic left you?",1688845487.0

Announcing a new game I'm working on with some friends about creating overpowered builds to mow down masses of bugs and crops! We were inspired by games like Brotato and Vampire Survivors, but wanted to add extra depth to moment-to-moment gameplay and build / character variety through the farming, fishing, and mining systems. The core of the game revolves around building up your farming plot, buying and upgrading weapons, harvesting crops to level up and expand your build, and recruiting pets to automate your tasks.

We're just at our initial announce phase so we've got a lot of work to do still, but I'm looking forward to eventually being able to share a playable demo. In the mean time, I'd love to hear any feedback you may have.

Combo Card Clashers is a roguelike deckbuilding tactical RPG! It plays like a mix of Slay the Spire, Monster Train, and a JRPG.  
  
The biggest difference between Combo Card Clashers and other games is its unique combat system. During combat, place your cards in a grid to play all cards each turn. The order is important and can unlock powerful synergies.   
Additionally, you can recruit enemies, assign attribute points to your hero, hire allies, equip weapons and gear, find game altering artifacts and more! 

There's a whole lot more to talk about (talent trees, shops, different character playstyles, and more), but I'd rather let you discover that yourself in the free demo (linked above)!  
  
Im still avidly working on the game, and making frequent updates to the demo based on suggestions, ideas and feedback.

A very important thing to me while designing Chicken Journey was to create a game without violence and fighting with enemies. Before this project, we worked at Flying Wild Hog making games like Shadow Warrior 2 and Evil West so I might just have enough blood & gore :D.

Instead of that, we tried to focus more on puzzles, writing an interesting and fulfilling story and characters.In this wholesome - cozy game you need to find the answer to the question ""Which came first: the Chicken or the Egg?"" It’s a very important thing to our chicken protagonist!

* Peck your way through various puzzles.

**Death From Above** is an indie, arcade style Early Access game set in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. You play as a Ukrainian drone operator working behind enemy lines to liberate their homeland by destroying tanks, accepting surrenders and returning washing machines to their rightful owners.

We're also taking part in the Steam Summer Sale, with a **15% discount** from June 25th until July 13th!

Ehem...

Our group of talented developers just finished Obstacles To Lovers for the GMTK Game Jam 2023. Following this year's theme of ""Role Reversal"" to a T, you play as a top or bottom pipe, struggling through relationships in App Prep, trying to open up your feeling to the handsome student ""Flappy"". Try to dialogue with your classmates, think of better responses as you play the classic game on your phone (because Flappy would always know what to do). Hopefully have the love of your life collide with you in this dramatic tale.

Games you are weirdly obsessed with,227,14s8apc,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/14s8apc/games_you_are_weirdly_obsessed_with/,435,"I'm thinking about Phantasy Star Online on a regular basis, but not just like ""yes this game exists"", but more like wishing there was a game like that now.

This is kind of weird, because :

* There are actually tons of games with a gameplay loop pretty close to PSO

* I don't have that many memories associated with this game (until recently I only played it offline with some friends on Gamecube, and our total playtime was probably less than 15 hours)

* I don't think this game is actually that good

But for some reasons when I'm thinking about this game, I'm thinking about exploration, adventure, discovery... Some vague concepts or feelings, that are of course fuelled by nostalgia, but nostalgia for something that didn't really happened. Even at the time, I wasn't really blown away by this game, it was nice, we had a bit of fun, but it was not addictively good either.

I don't know, I might just be the music, the sound design, the art direction (or at least part of it, I love the old school sci-fi stuff and the exotic environments, but the more ""Japanese"" elements like maid androids are a bit cringe)...

Or maybe it was the possibilities I was imagining back then ""yes this game is pretty bare bone, but imagine if they add this and that..."", especially when were playing a castrated version of the game, since we didn't had access to the internet.

That might be why I didn't even tried PSO2, the art direction went all in on the Japanese style, and they made the game more complex by adding a ton of usual MMO stuff I couldn't care less for.

Anyway, I'm binge watching videos about it on youtube, a lot of people have nostalgia for this game, but it seems most of it comes from the online part of it, it was often one of their first ""social"" gaming experiences, so it's not totally relatable for me, but I feel the need to see more people just talking about it.

Do you have games that you are weirdly obsessed with ? Games you are thinking about way more than you actually played or liked ?",1688647867.0

Is It Ok To Be Upset If Your Favorite Game Series Completely Changes And Evolves Into A Different Type And Genre Of Game,0,14tagmx,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/14tagmx/is_it_ok_to_be_upset_if_your_favorite_game_series/,99,"Games like Zelda, God of War, Assassins Creed, and Final Fantasy used to play and look completely differently. Thier new formulas and games however, often break sales records and do very well. So one way to look at it is if it sells more it appeals to more people, and is better for the devs and the future of the series financially so you should be happy, even if you really liked the old formula. Breath of the Wild is the best selling zelda game, and TotK sold 10 mil in 3 days becoming the second best selling zelda game of the entire series in only 3 days. FF16 sold very well, 3 mil units in a week despite being a PS5 exclusive. Assassins Creed sells better and better with each game, despite how many they are. Kratos was always iconic, but god of war 2018 took the series to new heights  
  
With this context, it should be a no brainer that you be happy for the series, because if you like it you want it do well right? But what if you liked traditional Zelda games dungeons and puzzles? What if you find the bloat and chore like rpg gameplay in the new Assassins Creed games exhausting? What if you like the big scale giant collosal boss battles in the old god of war games like the collosus of rhodes and Chronos? What if you liked final fantasy when it actually had rpg elements, turn based combat, and playable party members?",1688743770.0

I'm the author of [VIDEO GAME OF THE YEAR](https://www.abramsbooks.com/product/video-game-of-the-year_9781419762055/), a video game history book that releases July 11. The book is a year-by-year guide to the best video games since 1977, with each chapter highlighting the best, boldest, or most bizarre game of that year.

Along with my essays, the book also feature guest blurbs by more than 75 writers from across the video game industry including writers from IGN, GameSpot, Polygon, and Kinda Funny. Giant Bomb's Dan Ryckert wrote the foreword. Each chapter also features stunning illustrations from Wren McDonald.

As for me, I'm a Senior Writer on the Apps and Games team at PCMag. Before that, I was a Senior Writer at Geek.com. I've also been featured in Kotaku, 148Apps, Paste Magazine, and The Escapist. And if you've ever heard of the fake Street Sharks episodes hoax, I'm the guy who did that, too.

Story quality of the Trails series,3,14ryaav,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/14ryaav/story_quality_of_the_trails_series/,56,"After doing a lot, lot, lot of reading on the Trails series, it seems like the main draw to the series is the story.  How everything is all interconnected, etc.  

  
My question is how does the story stack up to other games that are well known for their stories?

  
For reference, from my point of view, these are games with incredible, well done stories or the story is just told in a really fun way:

  
Bioshock, Firewatch, The Last of Us, Disco Elysium, Witcher 3, RDR, Fallout NV, FF14

  
You could take any of those and turn it into a tv series/movie and they'd do gangbusters IMO.

  
This is compared to other JRPGS such as Final Fantasy, Tales game, etc., where the stories are all pretty good, but compared to most other media they're nothing really to write home about; they're carried by the gameplay.

  
Keep in mind I love a good Final Fantasy and all JRPGs in general, but I just wanted to get peoples opinions on how Trails stacks up in terms of story compared to the big hitters.

I am a first-year college student and I have published my first game THE HALF PLANET on itch. It's a basic 2d top-down shooter game I have developed using Unity. It's my humble request to you all to give it a try. [https://sarvochcha01.itch.io/the-half-planet](https://sarvochcha01.itch.io/the-half-planet) Here is the link to the game, and if you don't want to download the .exe file, you can try out the web version [https://sarvochcha01.github.io/the-half-planet/](https://sarvochcha01.github.io/the-half-planet/). 

The original idea for the game was a story-focused game but a few days into development I realized that it would require some good knowledge of C# and Unity to make a properly functioning game. Hence I trimmed down the game to a basic top-down shooter game where you have to find the exit from the maze while fighting the enemies. 

However, I will soon be starting on the next part of the game, the version which I thought about earlier, and hoping to complete it within the time span of the next 1-1.5 years with a good and proper story. If you really liked the game consider supporting it so I can publish this on Steam where it will reach a larger audience.

&#x200B;

Thanks for your time and support!

"With the rise of AI voice cloning, voice actors are being abused by modding communities who are cloning their voices and inserting them into pornographic mods without the consent of the original performers.",0,14qrudt,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/14qrudt/with_the_rise_of_ai_voice_cloning_voice_actors/,134," I am a long-standing and deeply concerned member of the modding community for various Bethesda games (Skyrim most of all); I am both a mod author who has created dozens of my own mods released on a variety of platforms (Nexus Mods and Bethesda.net, Bethesda's in-house mod distribution platform), and an avid user who has used hundreds if not thousands of mods. With Starfield around the corner and a new world of modding upon us, I believe now is the time for this issue to see the light of day before it can cause more harm.

With the rise of AI voice cloning technology, mod authors in our community are ripping voice files from various games and using them to create content pornographic mods without the consent of the original performers; deepfake porn mods using the voices of real people.

I have created a google doc that shows a list of offending content and specifically which voice actors have been affected by the practice: EDIT: deleted the google doc, as multiple users have now inboxed me to tell me they're going to support the mods. 

This list is not exhaustive, as more and more content along these lines is popping up every day, and manually searching for it is challenging due to a lack of discoverability tools offered by Nexus Mods.

Here's a video that serves as a great example of the issue: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uPT2-wsYDo

You can hear that it is extremely lifelike and believable, and it is used to create very explicit NSFW dialogue with no consent from the original performers.

Here's a link to an imgur gallery showing some of the explicit dialogue written out: https://imgur.com/a/5c7lKtk 

**Please be aware that the dialogue is graphic in nature.**

It should be noted that ElevenLabs (the most prolific AI voice cloning tool) specifically forbids the use of its service to clone voices that its end users do not have the rights to, but it does nothing to police this stance. It reminds users every step of the way that they are not to upload voice clips that they do not own or have the rights to, but nothing actually stops people from doing so.

On each mod page, there are screenshots and video samples of the mods in action.

**NOTE:** Some of the videos on the mod pages are outdated, showing more primitive voice-cloned results before ElevenLabs was made available to the public. The newest versions of this content all feature lifelike voice recreation using Eleven Labs. This content was created without permission, creating deepfake pornographic content without consent.

Nexus Mods, unfortunately, is not banning the practice from the site. Instead, they will only act if they receive a DMCA claim from the original performers or rights holders. I do not understand *why* they will not ban the distribution of deepfake porn on their platform as a blanket rule, but I guess they don't see it the way I do.

Nexus Mods has historically taken a hard-line stance on abusive content, and not all type of NSFW content is allowed (for instance, they do not allow mods that portray rape or beastiality on their platform, nor do they allow mods that target real-world minority groups with hate). I absolutely adore Nexus Mods and genuinely believe that they always try to do what is right (the site staff are great people), but I think A) they are not acting in the best interests of people who are now being abused on their platform and B) this is an issue that is greater than just them. The mods are being hosted on Nexus *now* because they have allowed to remain up, but the issue is the members of our community who are generating and consuming this kind of content.

I also believe that the Nexus as a platform is not conducive to discoverability when it comes to this topic for a few core reasons:

 - You can't even look at NSFW mod pages unless you have an account. 
 - The tagging system on the Nexus is up to individual authors. While they did implement an ""AI-generated content"" tag, mod authors can and are either not using the tag or manually blocking it, making it hard to discover content like this even if you have an account and know where to search.
 - Perhaps the most critical, if a mod author does not provide screenshots or video of the mod, a voice actor would have no way of knowing which mods affect them unless they also keep a copy of any given game on their computers and manually install the mods to check. To make matters even worse in this regard, the voice files used by Skyrim and other Bethesda games can't be read natively by Windows, and must be loaded by the game, so you can't even just download the mods and listen to the voice clips to see if you've been targeted.

This creates a scenario in which the onus is placed upon individual voice actors; they must manually troll Nexus Mods in the hopes that they uncover this content, and then file DMCA claims. I don't think this is a reasonable request at all when it comes to people making deepfake porn of them without their consent.

Recently, I tweeted about the issue, and my tweet has garnered attention among some voice actors, including some who have been affected by the practice of game mods being used for non-consensual deepfake porn: https://twitter.com/Robbie92_/status/1674944276109688833

This tweet has allowed me to signal boost the issue a little, and I hope that it will continue to help make people aware that this is happening.

I have also tried to contact Bethesda directly using every possible method (their support email, DMing community managers on Discord and Twitter, even tried reaching out with tweets) and I have unfortunately not heard back at all.

I believe, fundamentally, that violating anyone's consent in this way is *evil*, and the way our community has reacted to the issue is chilling. Furthermore, I am extremely disappointed in both Nexus Mods for not banning the practice on their site, and Bethesda for not taking action immediately and forcing Nexus Mods to change site policy.

As you can tell, I am extremely passionate about this issue and believe that the only way for this to come to an end is if enough people (including the affected performers, Bethesda, and the general public) make it clear this is not welcome within our community. Part of what is so insidious about the issue is that every single VO performer who has commented on it has no idea that this is happening. How could they? Unless you are an avid member of the modding community, there's no way to know that these types of mods are being consumed by tens of thousands of people. I make this thread now in the hopes that it will make more people aware of the situation. 

I thank you for taking the time to read. I really just want to get more eyes on this. I believe the only way this will be resolved is if more people see it and the community is forced to remove mods like this.",1688506861.0

**Footage**

Here is a [YouTube short of me explaining](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/QC86Kiy86v4) the game.

  
**Development Background**

The game has been out for two years and is the third game by our micro (two person) studio Pill Bug Interactive. The game we made before this, Cycle 28, was an experiment in how quickly we could release a short tight experience. Cycle 28 was enjoyed by critics, and even nominated for a BAFTA, but sales were nothing short of a failure. So with Making it Home we took the opposite approach, noticing that building games were super popular (and that we loved them ourselves) that's what we set out to make. What we didn't foresee is that a game like Making it Home would live and die by how many new gizmos you gave the player to play with when building their machine. Developing the game almost broke us, it was way over scope for a two person team. However we did manage to finish it and release something that we're proud of. The game was not financially successful, but we learnt a lot through making it. The game has workshop support and local co-op which are good skills to have as a development team, and we learnt something about our limits. The pacing of the single player campaign is something I'm not entirely happy with, potentially because we included an interactive novel which intertwines with what you're doing in the game - with lots of mysteries to solve. The real fun of the game is in the sandbox mode and the steam workshop, one of our players actually has used the vehicle building tools to make platforming levels and even a semi functioning competitive basket ball game! The game has hand painted backgrounds and the main theme was written for us by a folk singer! We launched the game in early access before we had built enough interest which really has restricted our visibility long term - another lesson learnt.  
  
I probably should have planned this ramble better - but anyway if you like building games and are okay with playing somewhat experimental indie titles then [check it out here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098220/Making_it_Home/) (it's like £3/$4 right now). I'd love to answer any questions you have (I teach games dev at a university for my day job so always happy to talk about this stuff)

The world is procedurally generated so you can go in any direction in this complex dream world.. I’ve made many boss fights and enemies that interact with gravity-shifting mechanics in the game in different ways. I’ve also made some strange enemies like giant arms and other limbs that attack from holes in the ground and try to kill you. You can also use a grappling hook to move around quickly and to kill enemies. There’s all kinds of different weapons such as regular weapons, shields, bows, machine guns and also weapons that are kind of alive.

Maeldor: Quest Of The Artifact - Maeldor Games - a story based 2d action adventure platformer with RPG elements in it sets in a fantasy world called Maeldor,20,14oq20r,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/14oq20r/maeldor_quest_of_the_artifact_maeldor_games_a/,3,"Hello, I am the solo developer of the game called ""Maeldor: Quest Of The Artifact"", a story-driven 2d action adventure platformer with RPG elements in it.

It builds itself around an epic story filled with different adventures throughout the Maeldor, mixed with lots of action aspects and since it has features such as character progression, decision making or skill trees, we can say that it also has some RPG elements in it.

I am a solo developer and I literally do everything by myself for this game, like the coding, art (%90 of the things you see in this game is handcrafted by me), the music etc. and because of that the development process is a bit slow but my main objective is to create something truly enjoyable, memorable and engaging. So rather than rushing things up, I try to pay attention to details. My biggest motivation in this journey is the interest I see from people, so if you are interested in my work please do consider adding it to your Wishlist. It helps a lot, especially to small developers like myself.

Here is the link to [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2230620/Maeldor_Quest_For_The_Artifact/) , you can Wishlist and Follow my game there.

Here is the list of things I have done so far;

\-7 Cut-Scenes Completed,  
\-3 Playable Characters Completed,  
\-Upgrade System Completed  
\-All 8 Chapters Arts, Level Designs and All Other Elements Completed,  
\-Mystery Urns (Buff System) Completed,  
\-2 Boss Fight Completed,  
\-Complete Story Written Down and First Part Implemented,  
\-9 Soundtrack and lots of SFX Made and Implemented to the Game,  
\-Menu UI and UX Designs Completed,  
\-6 Enemy Design, Animation and Gameplay Style Completed,  
\-2 NPC to Discover Different Stories of Maeldor Completed,  
\-Chests and Soul Points System Implemented  
\-Gamepad Support Implemented.

What Else Left To Do?

\-6 Boss Fights,  
\-Other Enemies in Chapters,  
\-Polishing and Other Little Things

As you can see I've completed like %80 of my game, and there are these 3 things left to do, but these are also going to take some serious amount of time, since they are not easy to implement (like boss fights) and as I've said before I don't like rushing things up, but hopefully without any major issues I'll complete everything and release the game late 2023.

  
I've also released a new trailer after 4 months and shared a new devlog a week ago, since I've made lots of progress, I thought it would be nice to showcase all the new stuff (like new characters, features etc.)

I would like to use the oportunity here during this Indie Sunday and introduce myself and ""[The Settlings](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771110?utm_source=is_723)"" to you.  
I am 40 y/o solo developer working from middle of europe and I've been working on this game for the last 2 years during my spare time. I really loved the games back in early 90s and wanted to build something which will give us some good flashbacks :)  
I would say that, even I am taking the inspiration from old, almost forgotten games the gameplay is fresh and unique! - There is absolutely no AI but only a simple set of rules, like we know it from Lemming games. This force the player to think about building placement and invite to constant Settlings flow opimisation.  
To allow this all I have made some design decisions to support this kind of game play and f.e. terraforming features are already available in early game, so everyone has all needed tools to build a settlement in own and unique way.

  
In the game you can also fight some fantasy monsters so if you are intrigued, check the [steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771110?utm_source=is_723) page!  


Thank you r/Games for the oportunity and I wish all of you great Sunday!

* Learn character stroke order interactively
* Adaptive lessons show difficult characters more frequently
* Uses real Japanese vocab and shows their meanings
* Pronunciation audio provided by *Learn Japanese Adventure

I've been solo developing my game ""[Netherguild](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1464220/Netherguild/)"" over the last few years - it's a turn based tactical roguelite about sending expeditions deep underground, with voxel dungeons and a focus on resource management.   
You explore, fight, camp, and go as far as you can with your squad before returning above to resupply.

# About the game

Netherguild is a ""persistent"" roguelite where you keep your characters with their skill and loot between runs (as long as they survive!). 

No attack RNG means you can count on your units, but random floors, procedural loot with its own abilities and characters with different class ""backgrounds"" (which are like subclasses with differing skill trees and personalities) mean that playthroughs can end up feeling very different. Also, watch out for perma-death! stretch your luck too far or too deep and you might just lose your characters.

&#x200B;

It's currently on [Steam Early Access](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1464220/Netherguild/) with a 10% off discount at 9$ USD for the Steam summer sale - this is the cheapest Netherguild will be for a long while so if it sounds like your jam, there's no better time to grab it! (:

# Why 10% off?

I plan to increase the price over time throughout early access - both because I think it's more fair to match the price to the amount of content the game has and as a way to reward players who supported the game early on with a better deal!

# Why Early Access?

A big reason for why Netherguild is as fun as it is today is player feedback - which is why I think early access is the right path to making it even better. It will take a while, likely a few more years from now before Netherguild is fully released. If you prefer fully released titles, feel free to wishlist it!

**Game**: Chasing the Unseen  
  
**Genre**: 3rd person single-player adventure  
  
**Platforms**: PC (Steam)  
  
I drew inspiration from games like Journey and Shadow of the Colossus. I cherish the gaming memories I had from these games and that motivated me to create my own.

""Chasing the Unseen"" invites you to immerse yourself in a surreal world, where you'll take on the role of a boy on a journey. As you explore abstract environments, you'll encounter colossal creatures and different sorts of challenges.  
  
The game's levels combine fractal geometry and other techniques, resulting in appealing and maze-like landscapes. Navigating these environments presents a challenge, and finding your way across can be disorienting.  
  
""Chasing the Unseen"" offers an introspective, serene, and relaxing experience, occasionally balanced with challenging gameplay. It's an immersive adventure that doesn't focus on killing or grinding.

Hey everyone! I am the solo indie developer of Chambers of Devious Design.

In this game you are stepping into the role of a henchman working for an evil mastermind and you are tasked with building an evil lair for your boss. Gameplay-wise it's a tactical turn-based base-building game where you take turns with your opponents to add new rooms into your lair - trying to find clever room placements and sabotaging your competitors as opportunities arise.

One YouTuber called it a ""Battle Puzzle"" game, which I thought was quite a fitting descriptor. The game plays out kind of like a puzzle game when you are building your own base, but there is also a heavy emphasis on duking it out with your opponents and trying to get ahead with clever room placements or sabotage.

If you've ever played a board game called Castles of Mad King Ludwig, you will recognize it as the main source of inspiration. I tried to catch the same feeling in my game + add some of my own twists into the concept.

The game is currently available for PC on Steam, GOG & Humble Store.

I am happy to answer any questions if you have some!",1688283998.0

I just released a new content update for it to coincide with the Steam summer sale!

So, what is Super Astrovade? It's an endless bullet hell where you have no guns and no upgrades, instead you use your thruster flame as a melee weapon and must rely on tactical positioning and twitch reflexes. 

It's all about mastering the mechanics and chasing a high score (think Super Hexagon or Devil Daggers).

My name is Greg (StarSkipp) and I'm the creator for Cover your eyes. The game was developed on/off for several years and was released way back in 2020, with Austin Jorgensen (pre proto Lisa the painful) doing the soundtrack at the time.

I actually started development in 2012, primary in response to the rpg maker horror craze of the early 2010's. There was too much emphasis on helpless children being trapped in haunted mansions and I thought why not create something with a grown adult able to fight back? Had change alot since it's early origins and became it's own unique beast in the end. At the very least I'm proud that it even reached the finish line!

**About**

Cover Your Eyes is an action packed 16 bit survival horror experience, focusing upon family, and the sacrifices we make to keep them safe. You will have to fight, think and escape out of escalating circumstances as the town of Verwood undergoes an unprecedented metamorphosis.

*A bit like: Sanctum, Hypercharge: Unboxed, Orcs Must Die, Wrack: Exoverse*

Release date: *January 11th 2023*

**What is GROSS?**

GROSS is a Tower Defense/First Person Shooter hybrid in the spirit of the classic Sanctum games. The game tries to preserve what makes both of these genres great individually: To solve the puzzle of placements and synergies that make a defensive maze efficient and deadly, and rewarding gunplay with many different guns and abilities.

Unlike other games that use elements of Tower Defense, GROSS is a full TD game - you can build mazes and place turrets pretty much wherever your heart desires. The FPS part is equally fleshed out, with many different guns, ammunitions and abilities. It has been said that the gunplay ""feels stupid good"" (by some rando on the internet who I've never met or bribed to the best of my knowledge).

On top of that, GROSS offers new and unique resource management mechanics. Cash doesn't just land in your pocket - you have to collect it. By foot, or with bullets, grenades and abilities. Be quick before the cash pickups get stolen or destroyed.

**What is the world of GROSS?**

It's a world where greed has literally turned into a weaponized disease, and you hold the key for the cure. Embark on an epic road trip and overcome all challenges to save humanity like the hero you are.

FREEZE FRAME, RECORD SCRATCH, **let's talk about the demo**.

Alright, in the demo there are very few hints about the story. The demo plops you into a lame tutorial with no explanation whatsoever before giving you access to two levels that you can play in endless mode, with everything already unlocked and no insight about the story. The demo is essentially a free lite version of the game and will stay online forever (there, I said it once again in public, no taking back).

**How has the game been received/reviewed?**

The game currently sits at a ""very positive"" rating of 85% (116 reviews) on Steam. I've explained above what's great about this game, so let's tell you why it's not perfect and in which cases you probably shouldn't get it:

*The game is very stressful*

A few people dislike the core mechanics of the game, which are that cash needs to be picked up (in person or with special bullets), and if you're not quick enough it gets stolen or destroyed. One of the core principles of the game is that it tries to give the player something different to do than ""shoot at the closest enemy"", and the (intended) consequence is that the player has to constantly be in two places at once. If that's your idea of hell, this game is not for you.

*It's hard*

The game was definitely harder than intended at launch - this has been toned down significantly, especially at normal and easy difficulty levels. The game does require you to play bother the Tower Defense and the FPS side in order to succeed though, so it is by no means an easy or casual game. If you're not building an efficient maze, all the best shooting skills won't save you, and vice versa.

*It doesn't run great*

This is perfectly valid criticism. Optimizing a game is a lot of hard work that takes a lot of deep technical knowledge. While I have improved performance a lot, if you reach a very high stage (25+) and/or play at Ultra difficulty and dozens of your turrets fight 150 or more zombies, you'll need a very beefy computer. To play through the story at normal difficulty, a halfway modern PC (e.g. 5 year old quad core + a 1070) is fine.

**Son of a gun, I'm in! Now what?**

The game is currently on sale (just like everything else on your wishlist). At 35% and a price of $8.44, it's the cheapest it's every been.",1688284808.0

Pedigree Tactics offers a unique blend of tactical combat with fusion-based teambuilding. I made it by myself, primarily out of my own unfulfilled desire to play such a game, since I was never able to find one that did it how I wanted. It's basically the battle system of Final Fantasy Tactics mixed with the fusion of Dragon Quest Monsters or Shin Megami Tensei.

Fusion is central to the gameplay. Monsters naturally only learn three abilities, and most have one that's unique to them. Fused monsters can learn up to 10 from inheriting their parents' abilities. With the right breeding tree, you can get any ability onto any monster, so coming up with your team is just as fun as using them.

If this niche is of interest to you, please consider trying out my game. A demo is also available so you can do so freely.",1688303827.0
It's a bit weird how environmental destruction came and went,2026,14n11ir,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/14n11ir/its_a_bit_weird_how_environmental_destruction/,568,"It hits me as odd how environmental destruction got going on the PS3/360 generation with hits such as Red Faction Guerrilla, Just Cause 2 or Battlefield Bad Company, which as far as I know sold rather well and reviewed well, but that was kind of the peak. I feel like there was a lot of excitement over the possibilities that the technology brought at the time.  
  
Both Red Faction and Bad Company had one follow up that pulled back on the destruction a bit. Just Cause was able to continue on a bit longer. We got some titles like Fracture and Microsoft tried to get Crackdown 3 going, but that didn't work out that well. Even driving games heavily pulled back on car destruction. Then over the past generation environmental destruction kind of vanished from the big budget realm.  
  
It seems like only indies play around with it nowadays, which is odd as it seems like it would be cutting edge technology.",1688133170.0

I played against Miro recently in AFF Online Ranked, and while I was pounding away at his mass smashing him into the floor I get my signature I'm elated, its time to bury big bad Miro, and then he rolls out of the ring, oh the sneaky noodle I thought, so I proceeded to taunt and he taunted back until to my surprise his momentum had fully recovered, and my once finisher was gone. Miro comes storming back into the ring, I think alright, this time I've got you for sure punk, so I beat him up again, I get my signature again, this time I say, no I wont let you roll out while I have my signature, so I proceed to lift up his dazed corpse and he rolls out, and taunts and taunts and taunts, so I do the same we continue this twice more rolling out negating all the damage I'd done and removing my momentum from the equation, after a long back and forth i get out of the ring in frustration to handle Miro and I get knocked out and lose to a count out.  
  
I decided after this point I'd pick up Miro and see if there was any tax to rolling out and to my surprise, no, all I had to do was click in my stick and out of the ring I went, to stand and taunt, I didn't lay on the ground outside of the ring and wither in pain, I didn't have a limit or anything to robbing my opponent of his super over and over as the match went on. Its at this point, that I found the absolute grave of the online ranked system.  
  
I finish rolling around in and out of the ring and being a complete butthead and I get into the ring to finish Malakai I give a combo, grab him slam him to the ground and pound him until I get my signature, I'm like ok taunt and this is over, so I setup my taunt, I get my finisher unlocked I setup, I pull it off, I roll my opponent into a pin and 1 2!!!!! ""Player has quit the game it will finish in the menu"" Hmm... I think well at least it finishes in the menu and I dont lose a match, incorrect, much to my shock and disappointment I was ushered back to the lobby, out of the ranked system, and no progess was made on my online ranking.... WELL THIS IS BULLTURDS I thought to myself, so in my anger I search out a report button, surely if the game is going to permit such a horrid system I can at least report people....  
  
This is my final point, its why I'm here.. (I apologize for such a long story, but I felt it needed to be included so I don't come across as a Salty McSaltipants) in the settings you'll find an option it says ""report player"" I think to myself finally at least a place I can vigorously smash my controller when people quit on me and cancel all my progress, welp thats also the incorrect assumption instead, I was met with a small brief window, that says if I have feedback about the game I should head over to their website and report it... it reads, ""Please direct any questions, feedback, or requests about this game to the link below"".  
  
I don't who is the director of this game, but they should feel ashamed. This is really bad, I mean all the other short comings of this game aside, just wow.  
  
I wish I could provide the screen shot I took, my apologies I'm new to Reddit, but I also didn't know where else to say this that it might be seen.",1688238818.0

>Capping off the Crossbell and Cold Steel arcs with a nice little bow, The Legend of Heroes: Trails into Reverie hits some high highs – such as with C and the True Reverie Corridor – and when it does, it's an RPG fan's paradise. But as an overall package, it feels like an easy excuse to get a huge number of characters together rather than do something meaningful with them. It's far from the series' best, but fans will find a lot to love here, even if we'd recommend seeking it out on another platform for the best experience, or waiting for a patch.

>It's also very enjoyable to spend a couple hours with one group in one area of the continent and then shift over to a different group to catch up on how their mission is going. The stopping points where the game forces you to pick up another protagonist's journey are natural and work well, and the combat and music are as engaging as ever. Any RPG fan who hasn't played a Trails game needs to find time to remedy that glaring oversight, and know that you'll have a captivating reunion-like experience waiting for you with Trails into Reverie. Even if it takes finishing a collection of 40-plus hour RPGs to get there.

>Even with a conclusion that may leave many with a heavy heart, Trails into Reverie is the farewell that fans deserved after following the adventures of so many beloved characters. In the making for over 10 years, Falcom has delivered one of its most complete packages thanks to the immense replay factor, making it a must-buy for any fan of the franchise.

**[PlayStation Universe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/39/playstation-universe)** - [Garri Bagdasarov](https://opencritic.com/critic/840/garri-bagdasarov) - [6.5 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-into-reverie-review-ps5/)

>Trails Into Reverie should have been the best sendoff one could ask for in this great franchise. Unfortunately, it's the complete opposite. The duality of its story takes away from the narrative, and the introduction of every gotcha mechanic present in most mobile RPGs hurts more than it should. Though its combat and writing remain stellar, the rest of the game fails to capture the greatness of the titles that came before it.

>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Into Reverie works best as a thank-you gift for fans of the series. It contains (and often enhances) everything turn-based JRPG fans loved about the previous games, but it's unfortunately presented in a disjointed manner that may put off those who'd just like to continue with the story. And if you haven't played a previous entry, do not start here.

>The Legend of Heroes: Trails into Reverie is a solid addition to the series, serving as an excellent epilogue to the Crossbell and Erebonian arcs.

>While some of the deeper world-building feels increasingly convoluted, and it's time for the series to move on to new pastures, it is great to have one final episode of glory with most of the cast as the game celebrates the series's combat evolution and at least partially ties up some of its numerous unresolved plot points.

>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Into Reverie is a fascinating culmination of most main characters' stories while paving the way for the future.

>The Trails series just might be the best modern and ongoing JRPG series around, and while it isn’t groundbreaking, Trails Into Reverie is yet another great entry to this series. The problem is the best thing about the series; it really only caters to its fans.

-------------

**[SpaceNerd.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/801/spacenerd-it)** - [Matteo Tellurio](https://opencritic.com/critic/9054/matteo-tellurio) - *Italian* - [8.7 / 10](https://spacenerd.it/2023/06/trails-into-reverie-recensione/)

>Trails into Reverie represents the grand conclusion of the events of West Zemuria and a fitting tribute to the heroes who have accompanied us all these years. Behind fantasy, politics and artificial intelligence, Falcom has once again managed to portray the humanity of its protagonists in a masterly manner, leaving us moved by the threads of destiny that intertwine as we watch the credits.

**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - [Gianluca Arena](https://opencritic.com/critic/3759/gianluca-arena) - *Italian* - [8.3 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/articoli/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-into-reverie-recensione)

>We would really like to see the crew at Falcom get a bigger budget to give full speed to this world, this characters and this combat system. Trails into Reverie is a tremendously solid JRPG and a worthy follow up to the Erebonian tetralogy.
>Just beware: you need to have played some of the previous titles to really appreciate the story.

-------------

**[The Click](https://opencritic.com/outlet/833/the-click)** - [Chris Ranta](https://opencritic.com/critic/8861/chris-ranta) - [8 / 10](https://theclick.gg/gaming/reviews/hajimari-no-kiseki-review-pc/)

>Hajimari no Kiseki is a deeply flawed JRPG with a main story that barely stands on its own but is supported by a fantastic cast and great individual moments throughout. The story may feel like one which didn’t need to be told for the series to move forward, but what is contained in the routes and episodes feel like concerted attempts to fix many issues brought to the table in Cold Steel, and set many of these characters and story beats straight so they can excel in future arcs.

-------------

**[The Outerhaven Productions](https://opencritic.com/outlet/335/the-outerhaven-productions)** - [Scott Adams](https://opencritic.com/critic/8755/scott-adams) - [4.5 / 5 ](https://www.theouterhaven.net/2023/06/legend-of-heroes-trails-into-reverie-review-all-coming-together/)

>The Legend of Heroes: Trails into Reverie is everything I wanted from the Trails series. We get a huge cast of playable characters, a ton of emotional beats and world building, and finally some great turn based gameplay. The three routes do tend to slow down the pace of the overall narrative but overall it is still extremely well written and executed.

-------------

**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Miguel Moran](https://opencritic.com/critic/321/miguel-moran) - [9 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/?p=441357)

>The Legend of Heroes: Trails into Reverie is a crossover epic over a decade in the making - and it sticks the landing so well. Longtime fans of the franchise are in for an almost overwhelming level of callbacks, story conclusions, and narrative fanservice. In-between all of that, the endless Reverie Corridor provides an addictive way to dig just as deep into the combat mechanics as the story digs into the furthest reaches of Trails lore. This is a massive ending to a massive saga, and as long as you've kept up with every entry so far, you're guaranteed to enjoy it.

Obscure Indie Game Recommendations for the Steam Summer Sale 2023,362,14mxgy0,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/14mxgy0/obscure_indie_game_recommendations_for_the_steam/,94,"I play a bunch of indie games, obscure and otherwise, and every 6 months or so I like to do a big recommendation post to coincide with a Steam sale. Not all of these are on sale, not all of them are obscure, and I think a couple might not qualify as indie games? But I liked them all and would highly recommend them!

# Early Access Update

* Since I last recommended [Spin Rhythm XD](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1058830/Spin_Rhythm_XD/) it has left early access! Spin Rhythm is by far my favorite rhythm game of recent years-- great soundtrack, great innovative control scheme, great visual polish and accessibility options. Highly recommend playing with a DJ wheel if you get a chance, it's such a blast!

# Obscure (<100 reviews)

* [Jishogi](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1960890/Jishogi/) is a visual novel combined with a collection of interesting Chess and Shogi themed puzzles. The writing is disarmingly compelling-- I didn't quite finish it, but the big swings the story takes have been stuck in my brain ever since I played it. It's on my shortlist of games to revisit and complete.
* [Madcap Mosaic](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1964330/Madcap_Mosaic/) has big [Dream Quest](https://store.steampowered.com/app/557410/Dream_Quest/) vibes. It's a completely novel take on the roguelike deckbuilder genre and despite its somewhat rough presentation is crammed absolutely full of cool ideas. Worth a go in its own right (there's a demo!), but I'm also looking forward to whatever this one's [Slay the Spire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/) will be.
* Continuing the esteemed line of Minesweeper-type puzzle games ([Hexcells](https://store.steampowered.com/sub/50074/?snr=1_5_9__403), [Tametsi](https://store.steampowered.com/app/709920/Tametsi/), [14 Minesweeper Variants](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1865060/14_Minesweeper_Variants/), [Polimines](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1892790/Polimines/)) is [Bombe](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2262930/Bombe/). Instead of just solving minesweeper puzzles, you program logical deductions to general minesweeper problems and have the game solve them for you. The UI is a little rough, but it's such a surprisingly compelling puzzle and a really unique take on this well-trod genre.
* [An Architect's Adventure](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1747510/An_Architects_Adventure/) is a very rigorous exploration of a simple set of block-pushing puzzle mechanics. Super chill experience and a sizable collection of high quality puzzles.
* [Elephantasy](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1459540/Elephantasy/) is a cute little spin on a metroidvania. You have access to all of your traversal items at the beginning of the game, but can only equip one at a time. As you solve puzzles with those you unlock the ability to equip two and access to harder puzzles and so on. Lots of secrets to find, lots of goodies to collect, and finishable in just a few hours. It also has an isometric 3D sequel in [Elephantasy: Flipside](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2284310/Elephantasy_Flipside/), which is much bigger and much weirder but still worth a go if you like the first one.
* [Lingo](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1814170/Lingo/) is like [The Witness](https://store.steampowered.com/app/210970/The_Witness/) if it had word puzzles instead of line puzzles and was set in the [Antichamber](https://store.steampowered.com/app/219890/Antichamber/) complex. It has some of my favorite word puzzles I've ever solved, and there are tons of great community-made maps out there if you like the base game.
* [Springblades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2222200/Springblades/) is a perfect little distillation of a small numbers JRPG. Many many pieces of gear that have tons of abilities and lots of interesting little synergies.

# Kind of Obscure (<1,000 reviews)

* If you had asked me whether I wanted to play a 3D first person [Getting Over It](https://store.steampowered.com/app/240720/Getting_Over_It_with_Bennett_Foddy/) or [Jump King](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1061090/Jump_King/)-alike, I would've said that sounds like the worst idea imaginable. But despite that, I gave [Beton Brutal](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2330500/BETON_BRUTAL/) a go and I'm *so* glad I did. Both because it's got extremely satisfying and smooth movement and, unlike the aforementioned games, doesn't have an ounce of cruelty or condescension. Just ambient noises, a nice soundtrack, and good slightly spooky vibes. Plus it gives you a great suite of tools to help you succeed, including a Scout mode that lets you fly around your immediate area and scope stuff out. Highly recommend!
* [Nowhere Patrol](https://store.steampowered.com/app/961660/Nowhere_Patrol/) is a great little indie Cuphead-like. I knew this game would be special when I finished the first boss without taking damage and was treated to a special perfect-run-only extra-hard final phase. Extremely generous game with great visuals and tight gameplay.
* [Can of Wormholes](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295320/Can_of_Wormholes/) is a sokoban-ish puzzle game where you gradually discover new rules and interactions with the very strange set of objects you are given to play with. Think [Stephen's Sausage Roll](https://store.steampowered.com/app/353540/Stephens_Sausage_Roll/) or [A Monster's Expedition](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1052990/A_Monsters_Expedition/). No game has ever had as many jaw dropping mechanical epiphanies as this one does, cannot recommend it enough.

# Not obscure in the slightest (>1,000 reviews)

* [Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1356670/Sakuna_Of_Rice_and_Ruin/) is one of the most peculiar games I've ever played. It's a side scroller action RPG stapled to a highly detailed rice farming simulation. Instead of leveling up your character via combat, your stats and abilities are directly tied to the quality of the rice you grow. The combat has multiple fun gimmicks (a very satisfying grappling hook, physics-based combat that encourages flinging enemies into each other) and the farming sim is bafflingly detailed. If you vibe with both halves of the game, there's nothing out there like it.
* [Wildfrost](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1811990/Wildfrost/) is a highly polished TRPG roguelike deckbuilder. It got a bit of a reputation on launch of being unfairly difficult (a criticism I wholly disagree with) but the devs have been consistently putting out updates with more content, more difficulty options, and more quality of life features. I'm usually not a fan of tactics games, but this one strikes a perfect balance between simplicity (with a max of six units per side) and difficulty (the position of those six units is absolutely crucial and often not obvious). Plus the art, music, and graphic design are all absolutely top notch.
* [Card Shark](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1371720/Card_Shark/) has you learning, practicing, and executing card cheats in order to rob 18th-century noblemen blind (and maybe stage a revolution in the process?). It's basically a collection of tiny card-themed minigames wrapped in a historical political thriller, but boy does it do a good job of dialing up the tension when you need to get a card trick absolutely right or get killed (or worse). I'd probably call this one the most novel game on the whole list.

# Basically Mainstream (>10,000 reviews)

* [Brotato](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/) is, despite its appearance, far and away my favorite [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/)-like. I'm a huge fan of roguelites that give you tiny actionable goals that reward you with new gameplay tools (and, even better, more goals associated with them) and Brotato has those  in spades: most achievements unlock new characters, each with their own game-changing gimmick and reward for finishing a run. And there are dozens of characters! It just left early access about a week ago and is crammed full of content.
* [Dave the Diver](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1868140/DAVE_THE_DIVER/) just left early access yesterday and is a really unique beast. It starts as [Subnautica](https://store.steampowered.com/app/264710/Subnautica/) meets [Moonlighter](https://store.steampowered.com/app/606150/Moonlighter/) but just keeps piling on more (and more aND MORE) mechanics, systems, and interactions. If you dig the core gameplay loop, this game has an astounding amount of content to dig into.

# Previous Recommendation posts

All of my recommendations from previous sales still stand! Highly recommend checking them out, there are some real gems out there.

>Dave The Diver will end up being one of those fundamental titles that people talk about in the same breath as Stardew Valley, where it achieves on nearly every front.

-------------

**[Game Rant](https://opencritic.com/outlet/60/game-rant)** - [Shane Robert Moyer](https://opencritic.com/critic/9443/shane-robert-moyer) - [4 / 5 ](https://gamerant.com/dave-the-diver-review/?newsletter_popup=1)

>Every moment in Dave the Diver feels unique the first time through. The constant changing of side-missions, the cutscenes when upgrading weapons or fish dishes, and the eccentric cast of characters, all blend together so well into a game that, when viewed just from the surface, might seem shallow. But players willing to dive into the meat of the game will find even more enjoyment than they bargained for, especially with its official 1.0 release. It’s a single-player adventure with heart, good music (‘Hot Pepper Tuna’ will likely end up on a lot of people's personal playlists), and a cast of characters that feel right at home around The Blue Hole. Its eccentricities make it memorable, and Dave might be the kindest and most fun adventuring protagonist players encounter in the world of video games this year.

>Dave the Diver shows a perfect connection between two genres, Adventure and Tycoon. While adventure element is deep, Tycoon part gives a speedy, hectic fun. On top of that, well handled B-rated vibe, attractive characters, and various mini-games are creating a synergy throughout the game play.

-------------

**[Polygon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/87/polygon)** - [Jeffrey Parkin](https://opencritic.com/critic/5083/jeffrey-parkin) - [Unscored](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23777236/dave-the-diver-review-management-sim-steam-pc)

>What makes Dave the Diver work so well is wanting to see what comes next. In another game that just tacked on mechanics and plot devices with no plan, it could feel like the padding around a threadbare premise. But Dave’s kitchen sink approach somehow feels like a perfectly logical, if absurd, escalation — like a Tim Robinson sketch in game form. It’s a teetering pile of mechanics and minigames that never gets around to collapsing because the balancing act is just too much fun.

**[Checkpoint Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/563/checkpoint-gaming)** - [Edie W-K](https://opencritic.com/critic/6031/edie-w-k) - [7.5 / 10](https://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2023/06/master-detective-archives-rain-code-debut-detective/)

>Master Detective Archives: Rain Code is an easy recommendation for fans of the Danganronpa series. It's got the same dark humor and an unapologetically weird premise, and it features a slightly different take on the contradiction-smashing gameplay that made the former series stand out. There's some room for improvement in what's been added, but if you can stand some stale anime tropes and imperfect graphics, Rain Code is a crazy enjoyable ride full of twists and turns.

**[Eurogamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/114/eurogamer)** - [Alicia Haddick](https://opencritic.com/critic/9900/alicia-haddick) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.eurogamer.net/master-detective-archives-rain-code-a-murder-mystery-in-need-of-conviction)

>A neon-lit murder mystery unable to uncover a deeper core.

-------------

**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [Benjamin Braun](https://opencritic.com/critic/4867/benjamin-braun) - *German* - [71%](https://www.games.ch/master-detective-archives/test/review-loD/)

>Master Detective Archives: Rain Code overall does a good job combining elements of adventure games, visual novels and mini-game-based action titles, with a minor lack of being too less demanding. The cases could be very suspenseful, but for this, the storytelling is too lengthy. In the end, not least the game lives from its exaggerated characters and its, in parts, twisted humor.

-------------

**[GameGrin](https://opencritic.com/outlet/436/gamegrin)** - [Alana Dunitz](https://opencritic.com/critic/7498/alana-dunitz) - [9.5 / 10](https://www.gamegrin.com/reviews/master-detective-archives-rain-code-review/)

>Master Detective Archives: RAIN CODE is a great mix of investigation, crazy word battles, and humour with a great cast of characters. If you enjoy solving mysteries and interesting stories, I am sure you will love this game.

-------------

**[God is a Geek](https://opencritic.com/outlet/111/god-is-a-geek)** - [Adam Cook](https://opencritic.com/critic/569/adam-cook) - [6 / 10](https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/master-detective-archives-rain-code-review/)

>While it has a vast amount of ideas that work individually, Rain Code rather feels like a missed opportunity that doesn't quite come together right.

-------------

**[Metro GameCentral](https://opencritic.com/outlet/75/metro-gamecentral)** - [Michael Beckwith](https://opencritic.com/critic/2486/michael-beckwith) - [7 / 10](https://metro.co.uk/2023/06/30/master-detective-archives-rain-code-review-unofficial-danganronpa-4-19024101/?ico=mosaic_tag)

>The overall package doesn't quite match up to any of the Danganronpa titles, but Rain Code's storytelling and characters make up for its minor shortcomings.

-------------

**[Nintendo Life](https://opencritic.com/outlet/136/nintendo-life)** - [Oliver Reynolds](https://opencritic.com/critic/4681/oliver-reynolds) - [7 / 10](https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/master-detective-archives-rain-code)

>Master Detective Archives: Rain Code is a solid follow-up to the Danganronpa franchise that demonstrates a heap of ambition from its developers and mostly lives up to its predecessor's impressive reputation. But while the game delivers an excellent cast of characters and some truly intriguing mysteries to solve, it also stumbles in its methods, introducing mechanics and locations that outstay their welcome and become frustratingly repetitive. Still, for fans of Dangaronpa and those who enjoy a good gruesome crime or two, it's definitely worth checking out.

-------------

**[Noisy Pixel](https://opencritic.com/outlet/711/noisy-pixel)** - [Azario Lopez](https://opencritic.com/critic/2507/azario-lopez) - [9 / 10](https://noisypixel.net/master-detective-archives-rain-code-review/)

>Master Detective Archives: Rain Code delivers an excellently paced detective mystery through its clever writing and memorable cast of characters. It’s not afraid to go to some dark places and have fun at the same time within its narrative, but the balance of these themes is crafted in a way that keeps you hooked. The puzzles are all clever, and the gameloop never comes off as repetitive or straightforward. It’s an excellent experience that rivals all other releases in this genre.

-------------

**[Press Start](https://opencritic.com/outlet/491/press-start)** - [James Mitchell](https://opencritic.com/critic/3659/james-mitchell) - [8.5 / 10](https://press-start.com.au/reviews/nintendo-switch/2023/06/30/master-detective-archives-rain-code-review-a-cheeky-engaging-mystery/)

>Master Detective Archives: Rain Code is a captivating and refreshing take on the mystery genre. It 
>uses a zany story, uniquely expressive characters and a perfect blend of mystery and adventure to 
>stand out amongst its contemporaries. While some performance limitations stop it from looking its best, Rain Code's strong and effortlessly stylish presentation more than makes up for it. It's a satisfying and immersive experience that anyone who's a fan of visual novels, courtroom dramas or both themselves to check out.

-------------

**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - [Gianluca Arena](https://opencritic.com/critic/3759/gianluca-arena) - *Italian* - [7.7 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/articoli/master-detective-rain-code-recensione)

>Master Detective Rain Code is not as complete and original like the Danganronpa trilogy, but it is, nonetheless, an enjoyable and well written point and click adventure that wil appeal to all of the existing fans of Kazutaka Kodaka.

-------------

**[TheGamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/731/thegamer)** - [Meg Pelliccio](https://opencritic.com/critic/1289/meg-pelliccio) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://www.thegamer.com/master-detective-archives-rain-code-review/)

>Master Detective Archives: Rain Code delivers masterful craftsmanship of mysteries that players will delight in unravelling. Though the more hands-on gameplay mechanics aren’t groundbreaking and can feel a bit too easy, the strength of the narrative alone and cleverly created whodunnits make this a must-play for Danganronpa fans and anyone who loves channeling their inner detective.

-------------

**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Reuben Mount](https://opencritic.com/critic/5284/reuben-mount) - [8 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/?p=441700)

>If you can look past (or appreciate) the brazen clichés and huge levels of fan service, Master Detective Archives: Rain Code is a phenomenal murder mystery visual novel. The gorgeous world, wonderful characters and genuinely well-constructed mysteries combine into a thoroughly enjoyable if bizarre experience. If other similar games like Danganronpa or Ace Attorney are your bag, this is definitely worth investigating.

-------------

**[WellPlayed](https://opencritic.com/outlet/382/wellplayed)** - [Mark Isaacson](https://opencritic.com/critic/4858/mark-isaacson) - [7 / 10](https://www.well-played.com.au/master-detective-archives-rain-code-review/)

>Master Detective Archives: RAIN CODE could have used its inventiveness more concisely, but what's here is still an enjoyable first entry for a new IP that holds plenty of promise now and hopefully into the future.

**[Checkpoint Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/563/checkpoint-gaming)** - [Luke Mitchell](https://opencritic.com/critic/4403/luke-mitchell) - [4.5 / 10](https://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2023/06/aew-fight-forever-review-not-quite-dynamite/)

>AEW had the right idea in wanting to focus on the nostalgia of the wrestling games we played when we were kids, but at the end of the day, the seemingly low budget and lack of polish is something that should be left in the past. AEW: Fight Forever has some fine ideas and its execution of moment-to-moment gameplay and animations isn't terrible, but matches can be won with minimal effort or drama, presentation is missing key things that make wrestling special, and the story mode is repetitive, boring and self-masturbatory. Fight forever? In this game? No, thank you.

>AEW: Fight Forever's good ideas can't save it from a paltry amount of content and somewhat inferior gameplay compared to its competition.

>Its a great campaign to bring in those that aren’t yet familiar with AEW’s product, but also those that are but aren’t avid gamers. This is prime pro-wrestling video gaming at its best, and one I will be delving into for years to come. Goodbye, and Goodnight. BANG!

>Over time, there’s certainly room to build from this foundation. But with the asking price and the initial lack of substance, it’s hard to see value in AEW’s first game upon release.

-------------

**[Digital Trends](https://opencritic.com/outlet/124/digital-trends)** - [Giovanni Colantonio](https://opencritic.com/critic/6533/giovanni-colantonio) - [2 / 5 ](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/aew-fight-forever-review-nintendo-switch/)

>AEW: Fight Forever will win over N64 nostalgists, but anyone looking for a modern wrestling experience may be let down by an unpolished, bare-bones package.

>There’s room for improvement, and it’ll be interesting to see how that takes shape, given that they’ve said the plan is not for annual sports game style releases, but instead iterative development over many years. Maybe adding in a cage match, smoothing out some of the games’ slightly rougher animations, even if they are hand-drawn, and adding commentary would be good for a start. Yes, I know, I’m asking for them to add in even more DLC, but it seems like that’s what they actively want to do here, and it might just be the right approach for the challenger brand.

>At its heart, AEW: Fight Forever feels like a celebration of the AEW brand and a culmination of the promotion’s achievements. While it may be hindered by its graphics and sparse career mode, AEW: Fight Forever shines when it is paying homage to the history of the company.

>It may not be the game changer like the wrestling promotion it is based on, but it is certainly fun and feels like the classic wrestling games from a bygone era.

>If nothing else, AEW: Fight Forever has potential. I’m happy to have a more arcade-style wrestling game, especially one based on a major promotion. The gameplay has a strong foundation, and when it's firing on all cylinders, the action channels the simple fun of the ‘90s and early 2000s. The rest of the package just needs to catch up. Until it does, even the most passionate AEW fans may have a hard time sticking around for this main event.

>Despite its lack of content and underwhelming career mode and creation suite, AEW: Fight Forever is a fun arcade wrestling title that harkens back to the golden age of the genre.

>All Elite Wrestling's first match in the video game ring is a solid outing that doesn't quite live up to its real-world product.

>An encouraging debut for the big new rival to WWE, with loads of welcome throwback nods to No Mercy and Fire Pro, and a career mode you won’t be able to resist playing through multiple times.

>No Mercy this is not. It's got good intentions and the right idea, but the game is not there just yet. I understand this is their first game, but there is just not enough meat on the bone to justify paying full price for this. The story mode is short, repetitive, and nothing you do matters. Matches are way too short, the creation modes are ridiculously limited, and we don't even have basic match options like turning on and off DQs or elimination rules in multiman matches to keep exhibition mode interesting. Maybe after a year or so of updates, this will feel more like a complete package, but I would recommend waiting for a sale or some major updates before picking this one up.

>AEW: Fight Forever offers the perfect combination of simple, fun gameplay that can be learned in a couple of minutes, but has incredible depth. Pair that with an excellent roster, a fun career mode, and an incredible amount of match types and unlockables, and the game ends up being a dream come true for fans of the fun, arcade-styled wrestling games of the past.

>Matches in AEW: Fight Forever are a ton of fun to play, with a career mode that takes inspiration from Yakuza in the best kind of way.

>Comfortingly, AEW: Fight Forever fits into a snug middle-ground, where it’s neither a huge triple-A feast, nor a dainty indie curiosity. It’s just a pretty damn cool wrestling game, delivering arcadey grappling, awesome minigames, and an enjoyably moreish Road To Elite career mode. The simplified fighting systems may feel lightweight next to the competition, but they allow Fight Forever to feel like a proper pick-up-and-play wrestling game. As long as you don’t go in demanding a gigantic roster, an exhaustive list of moves, and plenty of match types, this will be the wrestling videogame you’ve waited a very long time for. Like the tag team of Max Caster and Anthony Bowens, AEW: Fight Forever is The Acclaimed.

>‍AEW: Fight Forever is a throwback to classic wrestling games and a proper alternative for wrestling fans. The in-ring action is great, but its more repetitive elements and some strange choices stops it from being true world champion material.‍

>As a self-proclaimed spiritual successor to WWF No Mercy, AEW had big wrestling boots to fill. While it doesn't quite surpass THQ's classic N64 grappler in terms of pure gameplay, it's nevertheless a highly entertaining wrestling title with a pleasantly silly story mode and some frankly ridiculous weapons-heavy match types. Performance on the Switch leaves a lot to be desired, but it's still the best wrestling game on the system for now.

>AEW's first foray into videogames has much room for improvement across its odd-looking character models, slim game mode offerings, and poor AI balancing. That said, in the right crowd, you might enjoy it for its schlock and solid controls.

-------------

**[Press Start](https://opencritic.com/outlet/491/press-start)** - [Brodie Gibbons](https://opencritic.com/critic/3662/brodie-gibbons) - [7.5 / 10](https://press-start.com.au/reviews/ps5-reviews/2023/06/28/aew-fight-forever-review/)

>AEW: Fight Forever's focus is clear right out of the gate. It sacrifices things it can't deliver due to budget to serve up a wrestling video game that is so shamelessly rooted in Iwashita's genetic code with No Mercy. Despite its shortcomings, Fight Forever feels as time-honoured and classic as Hulk Hogan's trunks.

-------------

**[Pure Dead Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/815/pure-dead-gaming)** - Craig - [8 / 10](https://puredeadgaming.com/2023/06/28/aew-fight-forever-review-no-mercy-in-2023/)

>Those two stick around more than half a dozen hours will likely just be playing exhibition matches with friends or against the AI. If that doesn’t sound like enough, AEW Fight Forever may not be for you. However, if like me you are here for the gameplay then you will likely get many hours of grappling fun from a title that successfully pays tribute to the golden age of wrestling games.

-------------

**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Ben Potter](https://opencritic.com/critic/946/ben-potter) - [5 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/aew-fight-forever)

>AEW: Fight Forever is an incredibly faithful tribute to 90's wrestling gaming, and it's clear that a lot of love has gone in to ensure the presentation, gameplay, and atmosphere all harken back to that time with unyielding accuracy. But the world has moved on, and more importantly, wrestling games have moved on, and the dogged determination to honour what came before has resulted in a title that will ultimately prove incredibly divisive. Most egregiously the game feels decidedly budget while demanding a decidedly not-budget price tag, and while the product may improve with updates and time, in its current state, it's hard to recommend Fight Forever to anyone but the most hardcore of AEW's fans.

>Fun is at the forefront of AEW: Fight Forever and should be celebrated for achieving that. This is unfortunately a game that has its issues, and whether intentional or not, is a dated experience. The arcade wrestling is great, and such a different experience to what else is out there. It’s clear this was made with the purest of intentions, and is an honest to goodness game. I think as the name implies, AEW: Fight Forever will have a long life, but the next iteration will have to see some serious improvements to be competitive. AEW: Fight Forever is a newcomer game from a veteran developer, and while there’s room for improvement, this is a solid start for what is still a must-play wrestling game.

>I’ll give AEW Fight Forever this: When I was playing actual matches, many of my problems faded into the background. The actual wrestling is a good time and up to four players can throw down in a massive variety of ways with a huge roster or their own created characters. It’s when I came away from the squared circle and had to look at other parts of the game that its flaws were hard to ignore. Even so, I think THQ Nordic, Yuke’s, and AEW have a good start here. They’ve made a game that is at least fun to play and feels good in the ring, which is arguably the most important part. If there’s another AEW game, I’d like to see Create-a-Wrestler, crossplay, and the overall presentation of the game rise to meet the gameplay. For now, I’ll just try not to spend too much time outside the squared circle in Fight Forever.

>AEW: Fight Forever is a good callback to some of the more arcade-styled wrestling games of the past, but it lacks much of the gameplay and content improvements added over the years by the same developers to their previous games.

>AEW: Fight Forever brings me back to the ""glory days"" of wrestling video games with its easy-to-learn but hard-to-master controls, fun and entertaining graphics, and a KISS match selection that gives you just enough of a taste of what All Elite Wrestling is about. AEW: Fight Forever might not have the complex simulation look and feel that we've come to accept because of WWE video games over the last 20 years, but it's FUN, something that the WWE games tend to forget about.

-------------

**[The Punished Backlog](https://opencritic.com/outlet/807/the-punished-backlog)** - [7.5 / 10](https://punishedbacklog.com/aew-fight-forever-review/)

>AEW: Fight Forever has some small issues, but there is nothing here that affects the moment-to-moment gameplay. I would like to see more varied options in the creation suite, but I look forward to the continued support and DLC for this game. This is one I can see myself putting a significant amount of time into. Fight Forever, much like AEW itself, is a welcome alternative and a damn good time.

>Hearkening back to the good old days of arcade wrestling games, Fight Forever is an accessibly fun and awesomely faithful title that's sure to entertain from bell to bell, despite its numerous shortcomings.

-------------

**[WhatIfGaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/842/whatifgaming)** - Aim Nario - [7 / 10](https://whatifgaming.com/aew-fight-forever-review)

>AEW: Fight Forever is a return to the glory days of arcade wrestling games, and is a lot of fun. With a surprisingly engaging story mode, deep customization, and plenty of game modes to try out, this is the AEW gaming package you've been waiting. Unfortunately, it doesn't reach its full potential because of sluggish controls, often unresponsive inputs, and mixed presentation.

-------------

>AEW: Fight Forever rekindles the flame of the classic N64 wrestling titles.  Featuring a fantastic mix of nostalgia and new it is only let down on occasion by budget and scope constraints.  I hope this is the start of a new, long-running series that takes this excellent foundation and adds more variety on top of it for years to come.
