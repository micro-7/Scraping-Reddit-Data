READ FIRST: /r/coding RULES! Avoid moderator action!,130,tzfc78,coding,https://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/tzfc78/read_first_rcoding_rules_avoid_moderator_action/,1,"I'm reposting the rules here and sticky'ing it, because a lot of people see to not pay attention to the rules.

Interested in programming? Like to read about programming without seeing a constant flow of technology and political news into your proggit? That's what /r/coding is for. A pure discussion of programming with a strict policy of programming-related discussions.

As a general policy, if your article doesn't have a few lines of code in it, it probably doesn't belong here. However, things directly related to the actual process of programming - libraries, tools, and so on - are all okay, but please use discretion.

Things that are not okay to post here:

* Discord links - seriously, knock it off.
* Tutorial video links - these are commonly spammed and abused. It's more of a judgement call, but in general, don't spam the subreddit with ""How to learn to code"" videos, please
* Low-effort advertising
* ""I made this!"" - cool, I'm proud of you - but, seeing what you made doesn't intrinsically benefit others. If you write an article explaining it, the technical challenges, etc. - then share that!
* Self-posts that are attempting to bypass our ban on self-posts
* Playlists
* Homework questions
* Posts asking for suggestions for your personal project
* Advertising your new COVID-19 graph, your new game, etc. - See above - this is a place for the discussion of programming, not advertising your product, and not showing off something which is tangentially relevant to people who code.

To avoid a lot of self.coding posts, consider these subreddits:

/r/learnprogramming for posting beginner's questions.

For asking language specific questions, see list of known programming language subreddits.",1649457766.0

Semantic Version GitHub Action,14,14ua3o1,coding,https://github.com/flatherskevin/semver-action,4,"TLDR; here is a link to a GitHub action I created that manages semantic versioning of a repo https://github.com/flatherskevin/semver-action

Backstory: So, I am a tech lead a large enterprise company, managing several services. Whenever I go to creat a new project, whether it be a service, module, library, CLI, etc‚Ä¶ I am almost always immediately blocked by needing a simple automation tool that semantically versions and tags my repository. Now, there are plenty of actions out there that do an excellent job of tagging branches, with great community support. When I started looking around at actions that did semantic versioning, they either always included tagging a repository, were far too confusing to use, or were lacking the features I look for in versioning a project. I strongly believe in clear separation of duties for actions, so having all-in-one action that versioned and tagged isn‚Äôt what I would like to use, especially when, as previously mentioned, there are very mature actions to tag repositories.

Thus, I created semver-action. It is a relatively simple project that scans either the tags or releases on your repository, and performs the desired semantic version bump. It has logic to skip non-conforming tags / releases when determining which version to base its increase on. The action outputs your current version, as well as the next version in line. This makes it easy for you to pass that onto any further steps in your pipeline, even if it is just to tag the repository. 

The action is well tested with jest tests, and live action tests. I would love to get feedback on it, and possibly make building new projects just a little bit easier for you.",1688837316.0

In my experience the functionality of Facebook notifications sucks dog balls.  And in addition to the notifications that Facebook claims to provide, there are more specific notifications that would be useful.  For example, at the moment I would love a high priority notification for any event that is created in a specific Facebook group.

Update on my AI Generated Podcasts,0,13t7bdx,coding,https://github.com/AdmTal/crowdcast,0,"Hey all,

First - here are the stats: https://imgur.com/a/eU7BJvL

I‚Äôm currently making two AI generated podcasts.

I wanted to share some info in case anyone is curious how it‚Äôs going for me.

First, I have two podcasts:

 * [Emoji Puzzles: Daily Emoji Trivia](https://www.buzzsprout.com/2185630/share)
 * [Crowdcast](https://www.buzzsprout.com/2188164/share)

Emoji puzzles was an experimental audio version of my book: http://emojipuzzlebook.com

And Crowdcast is an experimental interactive podcast, crowdsourced weekly from the /r/Crowdcast subreddit.

I made Emoji Puzzles using https://www.wondercraft.ai, which is pretty great, you can hear the quality.

But I made Crowdcast by writing my own python project, basically emulating what Wondercraft did, cause I felt I could do it on my own.  I happen to be a software developer, so I‚Äôm into this kind of thing.  You can get all the code on GitHub: https://github.com/AdmTal/crowdcast

I generated 40 episodes of Emoji Puzzles, and have scheduled them to post daily, and they should run to June 10th.

But Crowdcast, I make once weekly and post fresh.

Let me know if you have any questions!

So far, I tend to agree - but that‚Äôs the fun challenge for me, to try and make something entertaining using this stuff.  I would love to have a project that produces something that actually entertains me.",1685193612.0
"Interactive, AI Generated Podcast in Python",0,13sypye,coding,https://github.com/AdmTal/crowdcast,0,"Hey all,

I make a weekly, interactive, AI generated podcast using whatever the the top 3 comments on /r/crowdcast that week!

I think it‚Äôs pretty rad!!  [Give it a listen](https://www.buzzsprout.com/2188164/share)!

You should come hang out, leave some comments, and get featured!

I‚Äôm here to tell you about episode #3 which just launched, and to give you some behind the scenes tech insights.

Of course, [all of the code is open source](https://github.com/AdmTal/crowdcast) if you‚Äôre into that kind of thing - feel free to open a PR, would love to collaborate and get feedback.

Otherwise, it‚Äôs pretty simple, I have a [script](https://github.com/AdmTal/crowdcast/blob/main/main.py) that pulls the top three comments every week, and I run them through a [series of prompts](https://github.com/AdmTal/crowdcast/tree/main/prompts) in order to build a full podcast script.  Then I use [Eleven Labs](http://elevenlabs.io) to generate the voice.  I stitch it all together with some music using Python, and then publish it using [Buzzsprout](https://www.buzzsprout.com).  I‚Äôm currently using GPT-4 to run the prompts.

For episode 3, I did something new to try and raise the quality of content and keep it interesting, I call it [Prompt enhancement](https://github.com/AdmTal/crowdcast/blob/main/prompts/prompt_enhancer.py).

Here are the user comments used for episode #3 both before and after prompt enhancement:

First, /u/liquidhot [suggested this](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdcast/comments/13lhis4/vote_now_for_next_weeks_crowdcast_topics_will/jks2etg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3):

    A segment about the lighter side of the dark web and how dark net criminals can come together to make the world a better place.

Which became this after enhancement:

    The dark web is often depicted as a sinister, secret layer of the internet - a place only for illicit activities. But could there also be instances where this mysterious corner of the web has been a force for good? In this segment, we'll delve into concrete examples of hackers and dark web users leveraging their skills for altruistic purposes. We'll discuss the role of hacktivists like the members of Anonymous who exposed high-level corruption in the Tunisian government during the Arab Spring, and highlight cases such as the ransomware attackers - Phineas Fisher - who claimed to have donated their ill-gotten gains to charities like Kurdish anti-capitalists. We'll also examine how the dark web has provided a safe haven for whistleblowers like Edward Snowden, enabling them to share critical information without the fear of facing severe consequences. Join us as we unravel the complex realities and unexpected positive aspects of the dark web communities, and how, in certain instances, they are contributing to a more just world.

Second, /u/tango_foxtrot404 [suggested](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdcast/comments/13lhis4/comment/jksycbg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3):

    A debate segment between 2 artificial intelligences on the question: Are we alone in the universe?

Which became this after enhancing:

    A debate segment featuring two cutting-edge artificial intelligences, each presenting opposing sides of the question: Are we alone in the universe? Drawing on the latest scientific theories, findings, and case studies, both AI debaters will tackle key topics including the Fermi Paradox, the Drake Equation, and the potential of microbial life in our solar system. Listeners will also get a glimpse into the current state of astrobiology, extraterrestrial intelligence research, and the implications of discovering life beyond Earth. As they debate, the AIs will also demonstrate their reasoning skills, natural language understanding, and ability to think and learn on the fly, providing unique and profound perspectives on this age-old question. Join us as we push the boundaries of both cosmic and artificial intelligence in this engaging and thought-provoking segment.

Finally, /u/dramatic-mongoose-95 (me) [suggested](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdcast/comments/13lhis4/comment/jkpy005/):

    Next weeks episode should have a fiction segment about the dark conspiracy theories surrounding the great British bake-off. The lies, the cheating, the gambling, the calories.

Which became this after enhancement:

    In next week's episode, we dive into the world of culinary intrigue with an exploration of the gripping conspiracy theories surrounding the popular TV show, The Great British Bake-Off. We'll dissect the rumors of lies, cheating, gambling, and the surprising calorie-loaded consequences. Delving into the history of the competition, we'll discuss specific instances where fans have uncovered potential plots to manipulate the outcome--including potential judge favoritism and explosive ingredient scandals. As we wade through these complex webs of whispers, we'll also investigate the claims of a shadowy betting ring operating behind the scenes, and gain insight into the true calorie cost of creating these sumptuous baked masterpieces. Come along with us as we reveal the secrets and scandals behind the oven doors of this beloved cooking competition, and learn how this apparently innocent show has, for some ardent fans, become a field of sinister speculation.

Xcopy and robocopy in a .ini file,0,13kssoz,coding,http://xcopy.co.uk,0,"Hey guys,

I‚Äôm hoping someone can help as I‚Äôm abit stumped. 

I have some software which reads settings from an .ini file upon launch. 

I want to utilise this file to copy a file from one location to another.

I can get the copy command to work, but I need the file structure, so I have tried using Xcopy and robocopy. 

I can‚Äôt get Xcopy or robocopy to do anything at all, which tells me they won‚Äôt work when run from a .ini file?

I don‚Äôt understand why copy would work but the other two functions don‚Äôt, unless .ini tiles are that old they can only use the copy?

This is further proved by the fact I can add the xcopy command to a .bat file and it works as expected, so the actual code is correct.

Is coding worth it right now? Will AI take over?,0,1392xcc,coding,https://www.wired.com/story/ai-coding-wars-openai-google-microsoft/,2,"Hey all,

I did try to find a questions mega thread of daily discussion to post this in but couldn't find on. I also gave the rules a once over and don't think I'm breaking any. Here goes:

I really hope I don't offend or anger any of you guys that have been working hard for years homing a craft by asking this question (and I'm sure it's been asked before) - if I were to start to get in to coding now (I'm talking beginner, codeacademy level) where could it realistically take me within the next year or so? I would say I'm very tech savvy, a perfectionist and quick to learn. Like the majority of others out there (I assume) apps, games and websites would be of greatest interest to me. 

A couple of smaller questions I have are: what language would you recommend starting with for both ease and transferability. And secondly is there a worry that AI will take over coding in the next few years? I see that more and more coders are using AI to write script and then just checking it over, eventually will the human element be irrelevant? I'm guessing I'm asking that as someone who hasn't invested anything in to coding just yet would you recommend me going for it or looking in to something else? 

Thanks, and again I hope nothing I've said has annoyed anyone. Definitely not my intention.",1683324203.0

Read Less is a totally FREE news aggregation app for iOS and Android that uses generative AI to summarize articles from 60+ reputable news sources into multiple shorter formats! The goal of this project is to provide an ADHD friendly conduit into current events for the younger generations and demographics with poor access to news! 

Operating costs are only about $400/month, so optimally the goal would be for this to always remain free, but should more advanced features be demanded, a premium subscription for avid supporters is definitely on the table! 

We are grateful to be one of the first (but not the first) app like this to be launched, and we hope this tool benefits you personally, getting you to spend less time on your phones, yet more informed and involved with current events!",1681857579.0

Coding a tool to get market place data,12,129tmd5,coding,https://nwmarketprices.com,4,"Hello,

My idea was to create a tool that extracts market place data from the New World Market and write it to a txt for example.

I‚Äôm only trying to learn how it would work to maybe Code a tool like this.

The question is, how can I do that. Is it possible to somehow send a request to the server and get the market prices. I only know it‚Äôs possible using a api, but for New World there is now api. Another solution would be a bot that ‚Äûclicks‚Äú on the different items and get the data, but how could I get the data and where is it stored.

These are more theoretical questions of how this works and how other games like guild wars 2 and world of Warcraft do it for example.

I only worked with Cheat engine a few times to read the memory and that would be a solution, but this would require me manually opening the market board if I‚Äôm right.

I found a side that has this data, but I don‚Äôt know how they get it :)",1680460125.0

A curious question about the beginning of computer programming.,0,110aokv,coding,http://google.com,11,"Have you ever gone down the rabbit hole of thinking how did the world begin, what was here before and how did a big bang just gone of nothin.  Like how does existence even exist lol.  

Anyway I‚Äôm not a programmer, im very tech and computer Saavy but by no means a programmer but it does infatuate me and something I probably should of took up when younger .. anyways I go down this same rabbit hole with programming.. like it makes no sense at all how you string a bunch of text together that to the naked eye makes no sense but a computer takes it as instruction and understands it.  

How did the very first programmed software or computer come about? You would think that there had to be code before the code for it to understand a code.  It‚Äôs them same brain frying query as the start of existence question.  

I can‚Äôt even articulate my question clearly because it‚Äôs so mind boggling‚Ä¶ 

But basically how did someone wake up one day decide they are going to tell a computer or whatever to do something by inputting sone language they made up.  How did the first computer come to understand this input .. electronics is easy, a signal is sent via energy to make something turn on or off or whatever but coding hmmm doesn‚Äôt make sense if you think of this way.. 

Just my random brain.. if anyone can break this down for me if not I guess there‚Äôs chat GPT.",1676189877.0
