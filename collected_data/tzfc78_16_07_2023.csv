"**Help! I was banned! What next?**

Hey, so if you were banned by a moderator, you probably broke one of these rules and posted something you shouldn't have.

**How do I get unbanned?**

Step 1 - don't message the moderators asking ""why was I banned""

Step 2 - send a ban appeal, explain the rule you broke, and say you're sorry. If you say the word ""tuna"", I'll know you actually read this.

Easy, eh?",i3yozay,False,,,0,coding,,tty2,1649457940.0,20,20,0
