"Lol, this reminds me of when I went to walk my friends dog while he was at work. I walked my dog over and left her inside while I walked his dog. His dog basically has the exact same pattern as my dog, but he's fluffy, and my dog is a short-hair. 

The neighbor across the street had to ask me how I got my dog so fluffy in such a short amount of time, I just laughed and said it was the same dog. (My friend said that that neighbor is always lost in his head with an old people illness, so I believe he seriously thought they were the same dog.)",js10wi6,False,,,0,Jokes,,notanotherkrazychik,1689395319.0,9,9,0
