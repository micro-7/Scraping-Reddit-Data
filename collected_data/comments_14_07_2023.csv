UPDATE: Found a workaround thanks to another user, see below:

I had this issue, fixed it with this steps:  
  
Close the game, open Riot's Client  
  
Click on the profile button on the top right of the screen, then click settings  
  
Select Valorant  
  
Change the game language to any other language and run the game, it will perform a quick update.  
  
Close the game and repeat the steps to change back to the desired language, it will ""update"" again.

\- Region: NA

\- Type of Bug: MouseWheel Keybind Delays Pulling out Weapon/Knife

\- Description:

When ""Equip Melee Weapon"" is binded to Mouse Wheel Down (or any weapon), and you have your other weapons set to any bind, there is a delay before you can pull out your weapons/knife.

For example, let’s say I’m holding any gun and I want to swap to my knife. To do this I’ll use Scroll Wheel Down. If I were to want to switch back to my gun immediately, there is a long delay (about half a second) before I can do so. This happens when the weapons are reversed (knife to gun and back to knife).

\- Steps to Reproduce:

1. Bind ""Equip Melee Weapon"" to Mouse Wheel Down
2. Go in a game and get any gun.
3. While holding the gun, scroll down and then quickly try to pull out your gun (any primary or secondary weapon bind works). When the gun is finally equipped in your hand, switch to you melee, then try to go back to your gun.

\- Expected Result: Swapping back and forth between weapons can be done quickly.

\- Observed Result: About a 0.5 second delay between either weapon equipping.

This has been an issue since the beginning of 6.02 :(

Note: This bug probably has something to do with the brimstone spamming the molly fix, since if you only scroll one notch of your mouse, the problem doesn’t exist.

**\[HOW TO FIX\]**

*I contacted support and they send me this and fixed the issue for me:*

Since this is quite an unusual issue, I'd recommend reinstalling the game. In some situations, a manual reinstall might not be enough. In which case, the alternative that I suggest in order to fully ensure that there is no corruption or leftover files that might cause this problem. For that you can perform clean reinstall, I'll share with you the steps for that below.  
   
Please follow every step carefully and in the correct order.  
■ Let's clean up the files from the game, and uninstall it:  
• Go to your C:\\Riot Games folder and delete the Riot Client folder.  
• Then enter %localappdata% into the top bar of Windows Explorer and delete the Riot Games folder  
• Next, paste %programdata%. Once again, delete the Riot Games folder from there, then empty the Recycle Bin.  
• Install Revo Uninstaller and completely remove Riot Vanguard and VALORANT from your PC.  
• Also make sure that you don't have an installation of VALORANT on other HDD drives.  
• Get CCleaner and clean all the registries and corrupted files from your computer.  
■ It is of paramount importance that at this point, you do a clean boot of your PC. This will prevent other apps from interfering with the installation.  
■ Then you'll need to re-download the game from here.  
• Make sure to install it in the default location on the C:\\ drive (we recommend having at least 20 GB of free space before the installation).  
• Also, make sure to run the installer with Administrator permissions.  
• You will need to restart your PC when prompted to finish reinstalling Riot Vanguard. And you can go back to the clean boot article and do the steps to reset the computer to start normally.  
• Before you launch the game for the first time, disable your antivirus and follow this guide on configuring firewalls. These are the filepaths you need to add:  
C:\\Riot Games\\VALORANT\\live\\VALORANT.exe  
C:\\Riot Games\\VALORANT\\live\\ShooterGame\\Binaries\\Win64\\VALORANT-Win64-Shipping  
C:\\Program Files\\Riot Vanguard\\vgc.exe

\-Type of Bug: Visual, Cheaty

\-Description: When playing Brimstone, I have noticed that after placing down smokes they will sometimes flicker, allowing me to see through the smoke which has on more than one occasion gave me an obvious advantage on knowing exactly where the enemy in the smoke is. 

\-Video Link: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wpV5fdETVKW-159TRUHdPZ9L1jRX2JEo/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wpV5fdETVKW-159TRUHdPZ9L1jRX2JEo/view?usp=sharing) The bug occurs shortly after 0:20, you can see smoke flicker off for a short period of time

\-Steps to reproduce: I assume just play with Brimstone, I don't believe it is map specific. I play on 50-100 ping, on very unstable connection so maybe that has something to do with it.

\-Expected Result: Smoke should not flicker

\-Observed Result: Smoke flickers letting me unfairly see enemies

\-Reproduction Rate: Happens nearly every time I smoke as far as I know

My games for the last week had ""unranked players"", but if you look up their accounts, they were silver, gold, and plat in previous seasons. So they are clearly not bronze players. So I've lost like 300 RR getting dunked on all day because the match making system keeps making veteran players smurf for 5 games before placing them at or near their old rank. My winrate is 30 percent in 20 games. What's the point of making all ranks in the game dumpster dive in the low elo? are you trying to make all the new or low elo players quit? They should be unranked for 5 games but they should be starting off games in their old rank. This is literally unplayable.",minecrafttt0r,2,False,,0,VALORANT,,1688222465.0,,2,0

Type Of Bug: Gun skin bug

Description: The new NEO Frontier skin has an animation that is accompanied by a sound when you get the final kill. When you get the final kill with it when the game ends the sound still plays but the game is in slow motion so it is not in sync with the animation.

Video: N/A (Don't have the skin so I cannot prove it)

Steps to Produce: Use the a gun in the neo bundle to get a final kill that will make the game go into slow motion. (I do not know if it has to be a specific gun in the bundle)

- Type of Bug: In-game   
- Description: If a Snake Bite is used from a Viper after the round has been announced to end, for the location where the Snake Bite was shot and/or where the Snake Bite lands or would land, the sound of the molly traveling in the air may persist for either location for the next round. This sound may persist for just the preround before barrier drops or may persist for the entire next round. I have confirmed with teammates that they can hear the sound as well.
- Video / Screenshot: N/A
- Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Start a game with Viper
  2. Have a round end with a normal game transition to the next round
  3. Viper shoots up a Snake Bite into the air before the respawn occurs. (For testing sake, we can just do this from spawn)
 4. After respawning into the next round, go to the place where the Snake Bite was shot from and/or where the Snake Bite was going to land.
  5. Listen to the traveling noise of the Snake Bite in the air
- Expected Result: You should hear nothing.
- Observed Result: The sound of a Snake Bite traveling in the air persists the entire preround or the entire next round.

* **Description:** So, our deadlock put a trap on the left wall which was probably destroyed by the enemy team and our deadlock died and at the end of the round when brimstone was pushing me he got stunned out of nowhere, which was actually funny but I think it was deadlock's sonic sensor which stunned brimstone and It's a major bug IMO.
