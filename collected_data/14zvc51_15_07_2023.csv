"Now CMA deal and it's over. Apparently (according to HoegLaw, if I understood him correctly), MS could close over CMA, but still discuss the deal. CMA extending their deadline six weeks is an indicator of that and not that they will stall, like some assumed.",js019xi,False,,,0,Games,,Kasj0,1689377171.0,365,365,0
"You can debate the merits of going for the PI, but the appeal was a complete waste of time with how poorly the PI case went. FTC is a clownshow right now.",js01nwm,False,,,0,Games,,RetMaestro,1689377351.0,269,269,0
"While the FTC argued poorly, the broad misconception is that they mucked it up and that there was a case to be made here.

That's simply not true, especially considering US anti-trust law places a lot of emphasis on the government making a fairly strong case of harm, ESPECIALLY with vertical mergers. It's somewhat easier to demonstrate the need for injunctive relief with horizonal cases (as one competitor is almost always buying a competitor) but vertical mergers are much more difficult to deal with.

There's a lot of economic theories out there that when it comes to verticals. Many even look at them as generally beneficial, even if they cause harm elsewhere. You can decide that for yourself.

Regardless, Judge Corley even gave them the benefit of the doubt in many of their arguments. They even got the markets they wanted for a PI, but even with those markets, it wasn't going to work. The FTC could have perhaps argued more effectively but the underlying fact is it that there wasn't a case here.",js06lhe,False,,,0,Games,,sunfurypsu,1689379624.0,190,190,0

now the question is: why is the FTC going after cases where they have nothing?",js018dw,False,,,0,Games,,fernandotakai,1689377151.0,118,118,0
"All I can say is, going after antitrust lawsuits is noble and commendable and very much necessary in todayâ€™s societyâ€¦ This just doesnâ€™t fit into that. Of all the deals FTC had to choose this one where merits are clear and present, and even then they did a very poor job attacking it.",js08y6w,False,,,0,Games,,team56th,1689380726.0,28,28,0

"When the publisher buyout wars start within the next decade, I wonder how all the people talking about how ""Vertical Integration/Monopolies are good actually"" will feel. When Sony starts going after Japanese publishers and make them exclusive to Playstation, I wonder how many people will suddenly say publisher exclusivity is suddenly anti consumer, while saying right now it's ""pro consumer""! 

Because everyone knows, Xbox making Multiplatform ABK franchises into Xbox console exclusives in perpetuity is actually *good* for gamers. Especially Playstation owners. Playstation owners not being able to buy Starfield is actually pro consumer. We all know this, it's incredibly obvious. The less people allowed to play the game, the more pro consumer it is!",js1510f,False,,,1,Games,,InterstellarPelican,1689397919.0,-8,-8,0
"Expected, but what a shame.

Hopefully FTC actually learns from this and provides better arguments next time (but they probably wonâ€™t). Microsoft being allowed to just buy two massive publishers is pretty dumb.",js01i5c,False,,,0,Games,,ILoveTheAtomicBomb,1689377277.0,-41,-41,0
"Seems to me that Microsoft can't make any exclusives worth a damn, nor can they build up any actual talent. They can't compete, so they buy up the competition. 

Interesting to see what happens next. COD will effectively be gimped for the next decade due to needing to run on the switch, for instance. 

If an acquisition war truly starts, who is going to get bought up? Will Nintendo, infamously acquisition-averse, start buying? Guess we'll see.",js10pt1,False,,,0,Games,,DemonLordDiablos,1689395205.0,-18,-18,0

So who is going to buy EA and Ubisoft? Maybe even Take Two could get gobbled up by Amazon or Apple.

"Finally with the ABK deal behind us, I want to see someone trying to acquire one of the big Japanese publishers next. There are all these talks of potential acquisition by Microsoft and so many quality publishers like Capcom, Sega, and Square Enix up for grabs, it's weird that no one has made a move yet. I really want to see what happens when someone does. Is that going to open a flood gate for other companies to try to acquire them? Or is it going to get shot down by Japanese regulator like others have speculated? It will certainly be very interesting.",js027zx,False,,,0,Games,,Due_Engineering2284,1689377611.0,-52,-52,0
