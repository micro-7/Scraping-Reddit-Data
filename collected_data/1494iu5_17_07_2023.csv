"In my opinion, I don't think many (including me) will be contributing to Discord, because

1. It is not asynchronous like Reddit
2. It has too much of unnecessary distractions in finding top posts.
3. No SEO.
4. The future is still uncertain there. It may also come up with similar pricing plans or rules which could harm the community.

Because of these, Discord or anything alike can never be alternative to Reddit.
I can't suggest alternatives, but I'm seeing Lemmy to be a good(growing) alternative.",jo3d6sl,False,,,0,robotics,,avinthakur080,1686743806.0,78,78,0

"I've seen this message in my followed subs (arduino, esp32, robotics, diyelec, etc.). My only question is:

With all of the combined talent across 8k sub-reddits, why don't you guys make your own new reddit-like app? I too will never follow a group to inferior platform; I would however try something new made by us the users that even if it needs work for a while it will be wholesome and original.

"there is no way reddit is going to just let spam overrun the site. lets be real, this whole movement does not matter as much as people inside the ""reddit 3rd party app"" community are trying to make it seem. AI is going to moderate the site, and thats just the way it is going to be for most of the internet going forward. there are bigger fish to fry, and if we dont like it, any one dev team can make a new reddit.",jon1es2,False,,,0,robotics,,nirehtylsotstniop,1687128788.0,1,1,0
