"Another patch where this is an issue, another copy and paste from me (#11)  
  
\- Region: NA  
  
\- Type of Bug: MouseWheel Keybind Delays Pulling out Weapon/Knife  
  
\- Description:  
  
When ""Equip Melee Weapon"" is binded to Mouse Wheel Down (or any weapon), and you have your other weapons set to any bind, there is a delay before you can pull out your weapons/knife.  
  
For example, let’s say I’m holding any gun and I want to swap to my knife. To do this I’ll use Scroll Wheel Down. If I were to want to switch back to my gun immediately, there is a long delay (about half a second) before I can do so. This happens when the weapons are reversed (knife to gun and back to knife).  
  
\- Steps to Reproduce:  
1. Bind ""Equip Melee Weapon"" to Mouse Wheel Down  
2. Go in a game and get any gun.  
3. While holding the gun, scroll down and then quickly try to pull out your gun (any   
primary or secondary weapon bind works). When the gun is finally equipped in your hand,   
switch to you melee, then try to go back to your gun.  
  
\- Expected Result: Swapping back and forth between weapons can be done quickly.  
  
\- Observed Result: About a 0.5 second delay between either weapon equipping.

This has been an issue since the beginning of 6.02 :(  
  
Note: This bug probably has something to do with the brimstone spamming the molly fix, since if you only scroll one notch of your mouse, the problem doesn’t exist. I’m assuming the game is trying to delay you from using scroll wheel to spam interactives that have an audio tied to them (ziplines, spike plant/defuse, etc).",jrxrz2i,False,,,0,VALORANT,,Twonewbe4u,1689344202.0,1,1,0

- Description: Yoru's flash, for you and your teammates, does not make a ""woosh"" sound when bounced off a surface. Enemies can still hear it.

- Steps to Reproduce: Throw a Yoru flash and make it hit a surface
- Expected Result: The ""woosh"" sound is heard by everyone when in contact with surface
- Observed Result: The ""woosh"" sound is only heard by enemies. — This is bad since it is now harder for teammates to dodge flashes and it is harder to know when the flash will go off if you aren't looking at it.
