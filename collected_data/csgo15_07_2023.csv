"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Counter-Strike 2 updates for 6/9/23 (6/10/23 UTC, 1.38.8.6)",42,145kfxr,csgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/145kfxr/counterstrike_global_offensive_and_counterstrike/,21,"Via [the Steam Community](https://steamcommunity.com/games/CSGO/announcements/detail/3680050666252335116):

**For CS:GO:**

# CASE DROPS
- Players now get a weapon case with their first weekly XP rank up, rather than after some amount of (idle) playtime.

**For Counter-Strike 2:**

# LIMITED TEST ACCESS
- A second tranche of users are in process of being added to the limited test.

# MAPS

### Mirage:
- Removed wallbang through door towards connector.
- Blocked gap in box stack top of mid.
- Blocked pixel gap by ticket booth.
- Added back jump onto firebox in A site.
- Fixed various player and grenade collision bugs.
- Fixed various minor graphical bugs.

# WEAPONS
- Fixed disconnecting players taking C4 explosive with them.
- Deathmatch bonus weapons now offer weapons from equipped loadout options.
- Added ""Replace for CT"" context menu loadout shortcut for USP-S when P2000 is equipped and vice versa.
- Automatically cancel drag and drop operation when switching away from loadout menu.
- Improved the look of SCAR-20, G3SG1.

# WORKSHOP TOOLS
- Fixed asset compiler bug creating stray files when running in directories that have spaces.

Rumor has it:

- Today's update to CS:GO is a server-side change, as such there will be nothing to download

- Otherwise, for the CS2 crowd, [there's another round of localization file updates](https://github.com/SteamDatabase/GameTracking-CSGO/commit/eac677b10d03b4d470ed292d15652e3372f7cb34) which are made possible in part by contributions from [Translators Like You - Thank You](https://valve.crowdin.com/)

- Size is ~260 MB for Counter-Strike 2

**Service alert:** due to many subreddits including enacting 48-hour blackouts at the start of next week in protest of the reddit administrators implementing abusive pricing for API access, there will be NO SERVICE on reddit on 6/12/23 and 6/13/23. The blackout will be respected no matter what occurs, including for public safety emergencies (such as if a CS:GO equivalent of TF2's Crate Depression were to occur).

Yesterday I deposited 200 dollars on the website, I used apple pay and I managed to deposit on the 3rd attempt because I had problems with the limit on the card and had to change it

With a successful transaction and authorization from my bank, I have been blocked from the site and cannot make any transactions

I was asked by support to take a photo of the credit card I was using to prove that I am the owner of it

After 18 hours of waiting for the development team to check the information I provided, I was informed by support that they expect me to take photos of the next two cards

&#x200B;

The problem is that I don't have any of these cards, **I haven't used them, and there have been no attempts to make transactions with them on my account** (as confirmed by the history on the website)

I only used one card

I just started to play CS:GO and I want to improve my in game performance.

For this I was trying to increase the in game FPS - By only changing the in game setting to everything very low/low - See the images below with the settings for more info - On average I had between 140/150 FPS while playing matchmaking.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lvh4hqv37mbb1.jpg?width=843&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=402ca63f49fd7d82f66dcdc94311d54283fab04b

Since then, I changed my gaming settings to Gaming On and my CSGO Graphics settings to High Performance.

It resulted in a huge increase on my FPS outside game and on matchmaking warmup to high 200's and even 300's as you can see in the photos. However, when the matchmaking game starts, still quite low - back to 140 fps - Often even lower than before to be honest although the game feels more fluid.

I did a test of FPS Benchmark map and the below was the result:

Could you please let me know if I am doing something wrong or how can I improve this?

I tested on can I run it and the below was the result - Also for you to see my pc components:

Thank you in advance!

I think this may be a coincidence,however most of the time these type of players have a low playtime in cs go with level 0 steam and 2-3 friends only.

It would be great to have diffent versions of the classic maps in CS2 for **casual mode**: different time of the day or even weather (sunny, cloudy).

For competitive, sunny maps should be the only option of course.

- will I get a ammo capacity hud in games

I can’t actually remember if it was always this bad or when it started but it wasn’t always like this. It used to run normal but now I would say 85% of the time I start a game I end up having to restart my computer at some point because my game freezes completely. 

To be more specific, in the middle of a gun fight my screen freezes completely but the audio doesn’t necessarily freeze. This is where it gets unique I guess but the audio will just loop infinitely, so if an enemy had thrown a Molotov the flame sound will just loop until I restart my whole computer. Task manager doesn’t allow me to end the task outright so I have to do a full pc restart or shut down. Also recently in the last month I’ve started to get a weird frame rate lag when I play sometimes which is new … and exhausting

It’s a very frustrating issue and I’ve tried a lot to fix it but I’ve had no success. I’ve verified the game files in steam or whatever. I’ve uninstalled and re installed more than a few times. Updating graphics card drivers don’t help. My graphics card is a Nvidia GTX 980 it’s old sure but I’m still able to play much more demanding games than CSGO and I have no problems. My CPU is a newer Intel i7 and my motherboard is MSI and pretty new as well. I play apex pretty heavily and it runs very smoothly. I’ve finished cyberpunk with this setup so I can’t see how it could be a specs issue.

All that being said if anyone has any ideas on how I can try to fix this issue please do. Even if it doesn’t work or you aren’t sure it’ll help send it anyways because I’d rather atleast have something to try. I feel like there’s just no way to play this game anymore and it’s really upsetting.",1688961651.0

[Q] Matchmaking - is it just me who can't find his place in the ranking system anymore?,1,14v02y4,csgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/14v02y4/q_matchmaking_is_it_just_me_who_cant_find_his/,0,"I uninstalled CSGO back in 2020 when I switched to Valorant, and then reinstalled it back when CS2 was announced, so I bought some skins and started to play like once a week.

My elo did drop down to DMG rank and this was new for me as I never was this low, but well, after so much time away from this game I felt like I need to learn it again, because my muscle memory wasn't really there, I was used to Valorant's mechanics. While I played CS 4:3 back in 2020, I am playing Valorant 2560x1440 on 32 inch. Just only this change was HUGE when it came to Counter Strike! I just can't play 4:3 anymore because my eyes got sick. And 2560 feels so weird in cs, like damn, it just hurts to play it. ANYWAY, STRAIGHT TO THE POINT

So I had this break, been playing since but I just play like two, three matches per week, I don't even play deathmatch or any other modes than competitive, and here I am, I got to global elite pretty quickly, but this is where the problem starts, and it is not a problem for me only, but also for other players that got me in the team.

I simply can not derank, because once I do, I quickly get back to Global Elite as this game feels so easy and I really dont even need to do anything, just run and gun. BUT THEN is the Global Elite, where majority of the players are active CS:GO players, that use strats, nades, tryhard and I end up between them. It's not a big problem for me if I lose because I know I AM NOT ON THEIR LEVEL, but my team mates are also mad as they are getting demolised because it's like they are playing 4v5 as I am totally lost. It is not the same counter strike I played back few years ago, the level has increased and it's good, but I find it just dumb that there is no rank for players like me, where you are better than let's say majority, but clearly not a global elite anymore, as this is supposed to be a highest rank in the game. It's like being a middle class, you are too rich to get any benefits from your government, but you are also too poor to live a decent life on your own.

In valorant such scenario is just impossible, you can't accidentally get to immortal (at least on EU region). You have good ranks like diam or ascendant where you are stuck if you don't step up your game, but they are also way higher thank golds, so a situation like this can never happen.

I am wondering if I am the only player with same problem? Like I can't seem to enjoy the game anymore, because it's either smashing low rankers, which is not so cool, or getting smashed by teenagers who play this game all the time - and I don't blame them.

Have they announced anything related re build or refactor of rank alghoritms for CS2? Will be there more ranks? Or will it be harder to get global elite?

Lower FPS on main account CSGO,3,14u2nav,csgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/14u2nav/lower_fps_on_main_account_csgo/,2," 

I am experiencing low fps (80-150) on main account but higher Fps on alt account (300-400). Same pc, same settings. Every thing on low basically and multicore rendering enabled.

I have Tried:

Moving all my skins to a storage unit

Unsubbing from all Workshop maps

Deleting all community maps(manly surf maps)

Specs:

gtx1660super

i5-9600k

16gb ram

Windows 10.

All that I can see that is different is that my Main account uses 100% of my GPU and alt using around 60% while getting more fps. Cpu usage stays the same.

Anyone maybe experienced this before?",1688818406.0

Will ping always exist?,1,14tk4fj,csgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/14tk4fj/will_ping_always_exist/,3,"Okay somewhat misleading title but I was thinking, will we always have to play within our region if we want a competitive experience or will there come a day when internet connection is so good, people in California can play against people in Sweden and Japan with no problem. With CS2 coming out and effectively eliminating tick rate which I felt was a thing that would never go away, I was thinking of what other seemingly obvious but not talked about things that would give the game a whole new sense of freshness, and the thing that came to mind is latency. I hope that in the next 20 years someone in Australia can play with someone from Britain, no problem, obviously there would be new issues like language barriers and stuff but it would be neat to see how the community would overcome this barrier like how they do in Europe. Also in terms of competitive applications teams in Oceania wouldn’t be out of luck in terms of having good competition so they would be capable of being relevant on the world stage. Anyway, I think it would be really cool if in the future ping made a negligible difference and was effectively eliminated from being a factor. Thoughts? Is this even feasibly possible or will ping always make a difference no matter how much technology progresses?",1688765568.0

DMarket Payment Processing Fraud - ANYONE DEALT WITH THIS?,0,14tgb7e,csgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/14tgb7e/dmarket_payment_processing_fraud_anyone_dealt/,11,"I made a deposit of $500, and with that being said, DMarket keeps telling me that the payment IS PENDING and they cannot give me an ETA as to when the payment will get through. They said it takes 48 hours for processing, well guess what, ITS BEEN 1 WEEK, and the customer service keeps telling me the same thing - ""We don't have an ETA as to when it will be finished processing, its all based on the workload of the executives...""

THAT IS THE MOST RIDICULOUS THING I HAVE EVER HEARD. You are a SALES company, and your telling me that you cannot tell customers how long that they are going to have to wait for a deposit TO BE APPROVED? YOU DONT HAVE A SALES DEPOSIT QUE? 

ALSO, WHAT EXECUTIVES are CHECKING DEPOSITS, cause most EXCECUTIVES are NOT processing DEPOSITS, at least at 99.9% of companies!

ALSO, anytime that you contact customer service, they give you a terrible reply off of a script saying that they cannot give a ETA on when it will be processed, and also, they said that DMarket has the right to not give any information on any transactions that YOU MADE, that is ACTUALLY insane. 

I have used DMarket in the past, and I can tell you now, this site is 100% fraudulent with that kind of processing deal, and the fact that they will not help you get any information as to where your money is, and that, is absolutely ridiculous. The customer service is TERRIBLE, and they just run you in circles saying the same responses, and yet, my MONEY IS STILL MISSING. 

WHAT KIND OF COMPANY CANT KEEP TRACK OF DEPOSITS MADE ON THERE OWN SITES, AND, WHY DOES IT TAKE OVER A WEEK TO PROCESS, HAHAHA, WHAT A JOKE!

Has anyone else had a bad experience with DMarket? Just curious, because from what I hear, the company has been in turmoil because of apparent new ownership or something rather, and people say the company has changed DRAMATICLLY in the last year.

Questions about custom languages.,1,14teyoh,csgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/14teyoh/questions_about_custom_languages/,0,"First of all, I think this post might be a bit confusing for those who never messed with the language files of the game. This subreddit is probably the only place I can find more people who also tried to do this.

So, recently I decided I want to custom translate CS:GO to my conlang (constructed language). After researching a lot, I found few meaningful results. One of them was a random Steam community post, which made me localize the csgo\_(language) files. I chose csgo\_english and renamed it to csgo\_reinsk. The process of translating is pretty standard, mainly after spending hours translating many other games. But, for some reason, the file isn't working properly. It successfully detects that I changed the language, cuz the game launches in English instead of Norwegian (my default steam language), but when I check the lines I changed, such as ""Settings Menu"", ""Play CS:GO"", etc. They're not translated.The game is using the csgo\_english file instead of the csgo\_reinsk. I tried editing the csgo\_reinsk file in many different ways, I even deleted the normal English file, which made the game launch in Norwegian again. It doesn't make much sense in my head. At this point, I'm considering trying to contact Valve's support, but I don't think they'd appreciate someone changing the game's files.

I can't be the only human being who tried to add a conlang to CS:GO in so many years of the game existence, so, if you for some reason also made a custom language for CS:GO, please contact me.",1688753913.0

Personal fear of CS2 backlash because of familiarity and creature comfort.,0,14t6626,csgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/14t6626/personal_fear_of_cs2_backlash_because_of/,6,"Hello there I've been having this thought. 

In recent years whenever something monumental has been released(not CS specific), it seems it almost every time got a negative recieval. Every time there was a change, some people would loose their minds and those people would be heard the most. 

I fear that the reception of CS2 will be similar, simply because people will say ""it's not what im used to"". And this creature comfort and familiarity buggs me a lot. I saw a post from earlier where someone didn't like cs2 just because it felt different in movement. I fear that the criticism will be overwhelming, because a lot of people deep down don't want change, they simply want more of the same. 

Well.. 
We(as a community) have been asking for something new and major for many, many years.. now we're on the verge of its arrival and I really hope that this trend doesn't follow this game. I hope people remember that this change will most certainly be for the better in the long run, and that in less than a year the same people would probably be mad if Cs2 was changed in some major way. 

What I hope is that it's received positively, and people enjoy it rather than looking in this sub when it launches to see an uproar of complaining because it isn't CSGO.",1688733514.0
