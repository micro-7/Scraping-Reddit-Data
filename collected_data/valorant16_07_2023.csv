New patch, new Bug Megathread! To avoid bug reports cluttering the subreddit and/or going unnoticed, a Megathread is posted after every patch so users may submit reports in one place. This allows Riot to easily keep track of the bugs by providing a central hub and also allows other users to confirm that they might have encountered the issue as well.

The enemy team was able to take space so easily.  There was a lot of util being thrown around so it gets hard to keep track of what's going on in a round. I tried to give you an idea of what happened that round, but it might be confusing. 

[Enemy team's push onto A site.](https://preview.redd.it/f5171fsaq8cb1.png?width=501&format=png&auto=webp&s=38a602dd0aa91d2bb53b784a3643ebefdefa5ad6)

As you can see, the enemy team is pushing both lanes from A main. I didn't know how fast they were moving and Reyna got the upper hand on me. I heard her footsteps, but thought that it was our Brimstone leaving sand. I got frustrated because we had no comms the whole game pretty much, so I say in text chat to Brim ""Where are your comms? I thought that was you running.""  

Their immediate response was ""Shut up, you're ass."" This is the first time they say anything the whole game. There were no comms after this either. Our Reyna chimed in and said that it was stupid to comm enemy positions when the mini map exists. 

At this point in the game I was bottom fragging, but the Reyna and Brimstone only had 1 and 2 more kills than I did (I was 5-10 or something with 12 assists as Kay/O). While our Neon and Jett each had 10 and 15 kills. 

What I said does not sound rude in my opinion, and it was not my intention to be rude. I just wanted to try to get the team to work together. 

Instead of saying ""My bad"" or ""I didn't know they were right there"", both of my teammates decided to be negative to me. I just don't get why most of the players in this community decided to respond this way.

The cap on kingdom credits should increase,1,150s27q,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/150s27q/the_cap_on_kingdom_credits_should_increase/,0,"Though technically there isn't a daily limit on how many kingdom credits you can earn, you can roughly earn about 1000 credits a day. So after spending 10 days of playing valorant, you get a maximum of 10k kingdom credits. Most items are around 5k so you lose half of your credits for just one item and then grind some more before you can even buy a second item.   
My shop had nothing interesting so I thought I would work on my agent contracts and again, things cost roughly half your bank and for tier and for 7 and above, you can only buy 1 tier at a time since two tier cost adds upto above 10k. Tier 10 costs 8k and if you buy it then good luck on buying assessories in the next week. I just hate the fact that there is even an option to buy multiple tiers together when it is literally impossible to have sufficient credits to buy multiple credits.   


Kingdom credits was a good idea but implemented so poorly. First the assessories are battle pass assessories so nothing ground breaking but I understand why riot did this. On top battle pass assessories, you also have to wait a whole week to see a new set of mediocre assessories. It will take you over 2 years of checking every week to find an assessory you actually want. On top of that, they put a cap on kingdom credits so people are limited to buying 1, maybe 2 mediocre assessories a week. If people chose to work on their agent contracts then they should forget about buying assessories from the shop. Also, make it so people can't skip tiers in agent contracts so they must spend 7500 credits on a player card before before getting the agent gun they want for another 8000 credits.   


Ideally assessories would rotate more often but at the very least the cap on kingdom credits should increase so people can actually buy what they want instead of thinking ""na, if I buy this I won't be able to buy another assessory""",1689468134.0

New gamemode idea,33,1500ydy,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/1500ydy/new_gamemode_idea/,10,"Name: RAUM (Random agent utility madness)

How it works:
At the start you chose a character.
The character you chose will decide the ult you will receive.
The gamemode work similarly to swiftplay so you can by guns and best of 9 rounds.
The core mechanic is random abilities.
You get 3 random abilities from various agent.
At the start of each round you get 1 random token that you can spend to reroll 1 ability at the bottom of the shop.
If you receive an ability from the agent you picked the ability will be empowered.
Example#1: i picked raze and get boombot. The boombot could be much faster/go really far.
Example#2: i picked KAYO and get KAYO nade
It could explode 5 times instead of 3 and have a bigger radius.",1689392353.0
How bad is smurfing really?,813,14zc5p7,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14zc5p7/how_bad_is_smurfing_really/,464,"I didn't want to make another smurfing streamer bad post but in the light of my recent games I thought I should. Also I'll spice things up a bit. So let's say streamer X want's to do iron one to radiant stream. Firstly for content isn't an excuse. But nobody cares so let's move on. So streamer X starts his journey at 0rr in iron 1. And for simplicity he curve stomps every single game and get's 30 RR every single game. That means it takes him 70 matches to reach immortal 1. (I think I don't know how higher ranks work) by then the matches are a bit more fair and effects of smurfing are less clear. And let's assume that his teams he gets put in during the climb are perfectly fine with smurfing so there are only five people a game that are upset. That means that during his climb he ruined the matches for 350 people. And this is assuming he got 30rr every game didn't lose once. So good job for ruining the match for 350 people. I'm hoping that I made some impact on people thinkimg about smurfing all though I doubt it

What is your take to handle those situations? - Do you experience it as well?,0,150dl1o,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/150dl1o/what_is_your_take_to_handle_those_situations_do/,1,"Hey guys,

I'm peak ascendant 2 and stuck to plat 3 - dia 1 after the reset. Not standing a chance right now due to different reasons.

I soloq a lot recently, because I've read that this will improve you way more when it comes to mindset. Since that seems to be my weak point.

Now following situation occured more than once to me - in different variations though.

Just an example:

Instalock Neon and Raze in your team, no mics - now the guessing game starts.

You either instadodge, because this won't work out - or you're lucky and you have two immortal  smurfs in your lobby, playing for fun. There is no other option.

Turned out neon decided to play fulltilt sheriff only from round one, not dropping a single thing while sitting on full money.  
Raze tried at least, still didn't com at all. Leaves me in a bad mindset from beginning on - not performing as well, getting insulted and degraded by the enemy team.

It's not like this is a situation that occurs once in a while. Recently I've found myself in situations like this A LOT - and it's killing my vibe with valorant.

I've not seen Riot banning griefers effectively, and how would they - there is no real possibility to identify one, a brimstone with 2 -20, might still not grief, maybe he has a bad day - and if he commits to the team and uses his util wisely, there is nothing to complain about.

Second situation:

Pistol round, you were alone on B, while the enemies pushed A - your team stacked 4 guys A.

All of them die, you rotate as fast as possible, get one shotted (even if you made one kill it wouldn't make a huge difference) and people are legit SCREAMING at you, telling you that you are bad at the game, should uninstall, whatever - and voting for the first surrender vote.

What is happening to this game right now??

What is your take to handle those situations? I'm not asking how it's possible to stay calm - but how is it possible to enjoy this game if you find yourself in situations like that a lot?",1689431641.0

Q ability: Hack, This ability can be used to hack any gun on the map, and if an opponent picks up that weapon they will be temporarily revealed (think like a cypher ult but for only one player), This can also be used to hack doors, when this is done then the door will not be able to have its positioned changed from whatever it was at when it was hacked.

C: Destruction: This ability will instantly destroy any weapons on the map in a radius upon activation

Ultimate: Magazine drop: When this ult is thrown any opponents in this range will have there primary weapon lose all ammo in its current magazine, if the oponent only has a secondary then the same thing will happen but with the secondary

Is it just me or is Deadlock the most broken agent since Chamber?,0,150n7yz,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/150n7yz/is_it_just_me_or_is_deadlock_the_most_broken/,5,"I think Deadlock is a super cool agent, ngl. But I also see some significant problems that aren't easily adapted to, and I wonder if you all agree. 

\-The signature ability is incredibly tanky and literally game-changing- Not only does it halt enemies in their tracks and completely destroy their crosshair placement and recoil to get past it, but the audio cue they're shooting it is also obvious and loud, meaning you can pretty easily swing and get a pick.

\-The ult is so broken. I know I know it's hard to aim and it only gets one. But as soon as you land it, it literally becomes unstoppable, and I don't think it'll be that hard to land it, since that thing is massive. The sound cue again is pretty nasty, and completely destroys recoil accuracy. 600 hp and only takes the damage of a body shot. That means that if you don't miss a single one of your phantom bullets it'll take 25 bullets to hit, plus you have no accuracy for a sec. The perfect time for deadlock to swing and kill you. 

\-She is so perfect for destroying the enemy mental. Gravnet can tank them into a damage AOE, providing free multikills. If you don't shoot the cocoon and wait for deadlock to swing, which would be the smart play, your teammate is hung out to dry and the enemy gets a free kill. Not nice. You do free them, they get put directly in the open, they're dead and it's not even their fault.

\- Sound sensor is supposed to be her weak spot as a sentinel. She can't perfectly hold the flank. But A) Low elo people are just going to make noise in general tripping the sensor anyway, and B) her utility is better at setting up a trap than just gathering info.

Personally, I think Deadlock needs to be nerfed a tad to make counterplay a bit easier. Maybe her abilities should be a little less tanky, because I feel like a Deadlock with even a bit of gamesense can absolutely wreck the enemies without much they can do without coordination that just isn't possible in casual play.",1689455572.0

I have also always loved learning about the lore of the agents and hearing their in-game voice lines. Especially KAY/O and Phoenix, their voice actors did an incredible job! The art and design team did an incredible job of creating a unique cast of characters that are interesting to learn about, and fun to play.

This was kinda annoying and no other agent require looking at a visual indicator to perform a fast action like a flash.

What i think they should add is some kind of sound cue when the flash can actually do its job instead of a bar at the bottom of the screen, maybe a hawk hoarse call and make it transition smoothly to the other sound when the flash pops up.

This should be more of a gameplay improvement update rather than a buff, since skye is already powerful with her kit. So to balance it, the enemy can also hear the new sound cue?

Tell me guys what you think.

Opinion on balance by me a low tier player.,0,1507805,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/1507805/opinion_on_balance_by_me_a_low_tier_player/,6,"Deadlock's GravNet is inferior to Sage's Slow Orb by every metric and former can only buy one unlike latter can get two thus former should also be able to acquire two along price reduced to 150 from 200. Also Killjoy has two Nanoswarm grenades that are offensive dealing damage while Cypher has four traps.

&#x200B;

Deadlock's offensive ultimate Annihilation range is too short compared to Sova, Brimstone and Neon as example that also have multikill potential versus only one that can be denied.

&#x200B;

Shorty is overpriced considering recent harsh debuff. Ammunition change for Vandal and Phantom should be reverted or price reduced to 2500.

&#x200B;

Stinger being worse value than Frenzy considering 2.5 times greater cost with inferior damage per round and hip fire accuracy along former has 0.65 of magazine capacity of latter.

&#x200B;

Stingers price should be decreased to 900 or magazine capacity increased to to 28 or 32 while Spectre needs recoil reduction.

&#x200B;

Ares cost should be increased to 2000 while it's accuracy improved by 0.1 point and cost of Odin should be at 3500, as for Operator it should be 5000.

&#x200B;

Classic should be able being sold for 100 as risk reward balance, secondary should be changed to 3 round burst instead of single 3 pellet shot.

&#x200B;

Light shield should be renamed to Basic with 300 cost while Heavy as Light at 750 cost and new Heavy shield with 100 Armor Points at 1500 cost.

Literally not even a week ago I learned you shouldn’t aim or crouch when shooting, it was just a week ago I finally learned I need to change my crosshair from the default

This has improved my aim, my game sense however seems to have gone down a bit, regardless I’m still doing better than I was before. Always going negative, to most unranked matches being positive

Before I play ranked or unranked, I’ll warm up in deathmatch till I’m almost only getting headshots with vandal, and I’m top 3 at minimum. Then I’ll usually hop into ranked. The first half of the match, I’ll usually do alright, then the 2nd half, I’m just eh, then after that I just can’t play

You’d think that’s just because it’s ranked, ofc it’s gonna be harder especially when they learn my playstyle, but here’s the thing, I’m bronze 2.

I JUST got this ranking a few days ago and yet I just can’t even win now, if I do I lose every other ranked match I play. I’m 0/100 hard stuck bronze 2 unable to kill anyone

And it seems like all the people that are better than me are 13-14? I just can’t fathom how I’m losing to kids in bronze 2 ranked after I warm up a pretty good amount

It’s not like I don’t know my operator either, I don’t really know the best lineups, but I use breach and it’s not hard to stun or flash people if I just listen 

I just don’t know what I could be doing wrong, or if it’s just me naturally not being good at the game. I don’t expect to be radiant, plat, or daimond. simply gold would be ok, but I can’t even reach silver and I don’t know why",1689376852.0

As you guys saw by the title, i have big big anxieties in-game.

First thing off, i have anxiety and mental health struggles (depression, social anxiety, full of self-depictation etc, got a treatment for that) 

However, when i queue in-game in general, i feel stressed and shaking all over the place, and my head is like paralyzed by fear and can't do anything logical. I don't play ranked a lot because i'm so stressed and fearful of my performances (which in my head will always be miserable).

 I'm super anxious that i'll be a burden to my team, be the bottom when i press tab (which is why i never play duelist, i never believe in my aim), and the worst for me is people expressing it in team vc, i really feel bad about expressed criticism and insults that can come in ranked. 

Do you guys have any tips about overcoming it ?

I take energy drinks as a substitute for coffee and sometimes I get an enhanced effect or a placebo effect. Without caffeine I perform like an average player, more or less. With energy drinks I play like a demon, no joke. I top frag game after game against Ascendants and Immortals. 

Now though, after reset, I get this demon side now and then but struggle a bit against Plats and Diamonds. Which is unusual because even my worst can is better than Golds and most Plats, yet my average play is Plat level and my best is Diamond. 

My aim is snappy, but quite inconsistent. I used to aim train but found that it didn’t necessarily help. My game sense is okay, sometimes crazy [godlike]. 

Sometimes it feels like a switch has turned on and people in the game just become a part of my evolution to gaming. 

I wanted to head for pro-play as I am adaptable and have the ability to keep evolving my gameplay to be better and better than my opponents.

My util using isn't 100% right. I get too agressive sometimes, my ain couldn't be worse and I really need to work on my crosshair placement. 

But I was able to get into bronze last act on my own and it got really better. Placement matches fucked me over as all 5 games a teammate left the game making it a 4v5 each time. Only ended up winning one of those games.

But! Iron lobbies are genuinely such an anomaly in my eyes. It's ranked not unranked but half the players there play it as of it's unranked. Instalocking an agent only to say midgame its their very first time playing the ageny so their util use is either non existent or dog shit. They leave mid game (seems like it's happening every odd game to me). Or they're throwing like hell. 4 dualists comps where I'm either Fade or Sage, yet I'll be the one ending up top fragging and doing all the work. 

And don't get me started on the lack of comms. You don't need to use voice just text that they're pushing from behind. Don't just say nothing and then get angry at us cuz they shot us in the back too.  

Players in iron don't seem to know it's a teamgame either and just go off doing whatever they feel like leaving me to hang dry on my own, holding site while they're off pushing all over site leaving me really vulnerable. 

And I won't lie, whenever something like that happens it really affects my mental and I start playing worse which of course diminishes the chances of us winning even more.

Tired of people complain about smurfs,0,14zuw19,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14zuw19/tired_of_people_complain_about_smurfs/,2,"I've seen so many posts on here about the smurfing subject. I do not have a Smurf account and yes I am a gold player. 


First of all, it's frustrating as hell when you play against a Smurf. It should not be a part of the game, but it is.  After you realize a Smurf is on the other team, you lose confidence, every peak is terrifying, and you eventually give up and accept the loss.  But I'm tired of hearing people cry and complain and whine about not ranking up because of smurfs. Ranking up is not easy and it takes a lot of work even to just improve one rank.  There's something beautiful in getting your ass kicked. You get it kicked over and over, and eventually you have a break thru and realize , ""wow that angle I was holding post plant sucks"" You eventually get better! Nobody complained about this in other games before ranked modes became popular. Call of duty is a great example. You would get your ass kicked every day until you finally were the one handing out the ass kickings. 

My second point is riot does not envy your account. They are not loading the other team with Smurf accounts everytime. In fact you are just as likely to get a Smurf on your team as you are to face one. By queing competitive, your goal should be to rank up. If it's not, go play unrated if you want to just have fun.  You should be playing a ton of matches over an act. It will statistically even out and be a non issue for you. Smurfs are not holding you back. YOU ARE. 

Just one last point I think there are things riot can do to help eliminate smurfs and they have done some. This is a free to play game and the issue of smurfing will always be present no matter what so pick yourself up off the mat and get out there again.",1689375418.0

70% of games have a smurf maybe

20% of games have a confirmed smurf

1.3 smurfs per game on average

&#x200B;

In my opinion, smurfing is a very important issue at the lower ranks especially. It also does not help you learn when you are smurfed upon because you will just have to play cheese starts to win like sitting in a corner waiting for the smurf to w key into spawn which wouldn't be a viable strategy for the rest of your games. 

&#x200B;

What could riot do?

1. Make it against TOS
2. Enforce on content creators. They are the role models of the community.
3. Some method of not allowing alt accounts? (give suggestions below)

BLD sScary is GIGACHADSON This guy's life is really interesting.,94,14ygiya,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14ygiya/bld_sscary_is_gigachadson_this_guys_life_is/,7,"sScary explain why he choice bleed esports to complete ascension but not a team in the league ?

I Just watched his lifelong interview on FPSThailand to day. The video is 3 hours long and he tells the story from his birth to present day. He explained everthing why he came to bleed esports(BLD). 

Before the league started, 10 teams from non-leagues wanted to buy him and 6 teams from leagues wanted him to. He didn't say what the other 15 teams is, because he didn't want to get in trouble with the teams he didn't join. 

sScray decided to stay for a long time and rejected many teams until BLD approached him for the 5th time and offered him a huge sum of money. 

For sScary He has two goals in life. 

In short term, he wants himself and his team to win the league or masters or world championships. 

In long term, he wanted to live a life with a lot of money for retirement and help his family debt. 

And he choice long term goal His family had a debt of 7m baht(aound 200K USD). After he decided to enter BLD and received the money, he called his parents to come over to him. before transferring 7 million bath to pay debts to the family And he also transferred another 1m baht to his parents to spend in life.  

His father was ill and retired early. Causing his mother to be the only person in the house who still has to work and pay debts. As for sScay, he has been earning money to spend himself since the age of 17 from opening a pirated minecraft sever. He has lived like this until he graduated from university. Without asking for money from his parents, there was only tuition money that his parents were willing to pay because they wanted him to finish university.

when he pays his family debt His parents were crying because they didn't think that the boy they raise and used to scold and hit with clothes hanger every time he was addicted to video games would end the family's debt problems. 

 GIGACHADSON indeed.  

About the money he did not explain how much money he earn from BLD was. I'm guessing it should go up to 1m USD because he said interview . almost the rest of the money is around 80 percent after he pay debt for his familly, he invests them in business and keeps it for retirement.

Chamber needs these QOL changes,3,14z47rt,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14z47rt/chamber_needs_these_qol_changes/,8,"I've recently had a bit of frustration on this, playing chamber. It's specifically how awkward it can be to recall his trip (c) and tp pylon (e).

I'm a little bit confused as to why we cant just have it be like KJ's util? Hold said button down to recall said util. 

The reason it matters so much is because the cooldown only starts as soon as u recall them, unless u just used ur tp (and in this case, its not a problem really, but still). Having to turn around to recall ur tp and ur trip leaves u very exposed to beng shot if ur flanking or going somewhere away from safety, not to mention how tedious and just unecessary it is. 

Just making this post to see if anyone else shares these thoughts, being able to recall trip and tp without having to 180° would be a much needed QOL change IMO. I tried thinking of good reasons to keep it as is, but I cant rly find any reason as to why.

A question for anyone out there with sick aim,58,14ygeef,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14ygeef/a_question_for_anyone_out_there_with_sick_aim/,68,"I'm still quite new to Valorant and it's my first ever FPS game(if we don't count my messing around in CS 1.6 back when I was like 7 years old). I started playing around the end of May and to say I was a bit overwhelmed would be an understatement. 


My main issue is that my aim is trash. I mostly get body shots according to Valo Tracker and I do get more headshots than leg shots(thank god for that) but, in general, I find myself losing duels a lot because I might get 4 body shots on someone but they'll always headshot me. I also find myself getting owned a lot by crouch sprayers because I trained my cursor placement at roughly head level and then my reaction time when someone crouches is so slow, I'm dead by the time I drag my crosshair lower to headshot them. About 7/10 times I lose to a crouch sprayer. 


So my main question is: how do I improve my aim? Is there actually a sweet spot for crosshair placement? Should I start crouch spraying too?(I genuinely don't know when I should/shouldn't crouch as I never really do it.). 


One other tidbit of information is that my best weapon overall seems to be the Ghost of all things. I tend to do better on pistol rounds and will sometimes fall onto using Ghost even when my whole team are using Vandals. My 2nd best is the Vandall and I do use it a lot but the Ghost seems to be my comfort weapon. Heck, I was playing KJ on Lotus yesterday and for most of the rounds I was top fragging and my team even mentioned how ""everyone using Vandals and dying and here's KJ with a Ghost carrying us."". 


So adding from that, how do I get more comfortable with other guns? I can only reliably use Ghost, Spectre and Vandall, everything else is just strange to me. I can't use snipers, I don't get in people's faces so shotguns are very situational, I feel like a small child when holding an Odin and quite frankly I don't even know the names of the other guns for the most part. They get overlooked so much I feel like an absent mother to my children so to speak. 


Sorry, I bet you guys get these questions a lot but I'd really like to improve so I don't feel like a burden to my teams 8/10 times. Thanks in advance!

EDIT: I've read all of your replies and even though I haven't had time to reply to everyone, I want to thank all of you for all the great advice and suggestions!

Valorant Agents in the style of Soulsborne/Elden Ring Bosses! Entry 2-- Viper (art by me!),2,14z4rpr,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14z4rpr/valorant_agents_in_the_style_of_soulsborneelden/,0,"[Viper Boss Art](https://imgur.com/gallery/cHvBzC7)

Second installment in my crossover between Valorant agents in a Soulsborne boss style, Viper! A fascinating character with plenty of potential for souls lore, this was a very fun piece to consider the details of :)

Some design notes:

\- I feel like Viper would play into her strengths as a controller in her fight, coming off as an unassuming easy target, then filling the arena with her toxins as soon as the player attempts to strike. (From within the noxious fog, something massive slithers from all directions.) 

\- My original idea was to lean into body modification, and have her lower half be a snake woman, lamia-esque. However, Dark Souls 2 already has a boss like that, Mytha, the Baneful Queen. She's a unique boss that also has poison mechanics, so I felt that taking that route would feel too borrowed from existing characters. 

\- Instead, I chose to lean towards her toxician path in my outfit design, while maintaining snake motifs. I took heavy inspiration from plague doctors, and gave her mask a variation of the classic beak shape combined with her gas filters on the sides. Her neck cowl connects to the mask similarly, and her pouch and belt with rounded poison bottles fits the vibe as well. 

\- In terms of snake motifs, I wanted to keep the ""Viper"" in the design, so her shoulder pauldrons and arm braces are styled to be somewhat reminiscent of viper horns. Along with the viper spirit summon, and the one on her arm as well, I felt I kept it pretty on the nose lol. 

\- (The classic Plague Doc boss is Crystal Sage, from DS3, and despite being a mid boss at best, I've drawn inspiration from its themes for both boss designs that I've made so far lmfao) anwyays, thanks for reading this far :) which agent should I do next? ",1689304411.0

Past 5 placements me and my friend have been matched up with some of the worst teammates one could imagine. Multiple non-talking games where half of them just rush and die. As I said above I dont take this game too seriously since Im just testing it out, but me getting silver 2 after 5 quick placements when I was placed in gold 3 / plat 1 before season change is mad.

I'm basically bound to get teammates off the same quality as placements now that I am ranked this low. This screams league-of-legends vibes.

I recently wanted to start a new programming project. The idea was to create an app or website that would display the statistical positioning of professional players in pro maps. For example the project would display that 92% of Professional Sova players play back site on Haven C. 

My question does anyone have any idea of current websites or places where I can obtain this data or if there is currently a live map website that always displays player positions in pro games. As when the observers go into a players POV you lose the enemy positioning on the map. 

If there is nothing like this, the plan is just to use a bot to record player positions through the live streams.  Thank you for all and any help.",1689283096.0

I was dia 2 in episode 5 and is there any ranking changes, like is it there now past dia people in plat or gold now because they get more better people in dia. What is meta agents and what agents should I avoid now. Is it better to have duo, going solo or having full stack for queing? All advices are welcome. :D",1689291228.0

However I feel everytime I rank up I deal with a different problem and this frustration keep going.   
1. Iron rank I just had to deal with players with no skill, horrible net connection and 0 communication.   
2. To reach bronze I had to understand the game, but people don't so another frustration starts like walking like horses, don't care about the spike and SMURF players with 30-5 kills killing my matches.   
3. God finnaly in silver, people know how to play right? Yeah but if someone don't think like You they start afk and trolling with Phoenix.    
4. After reaching gold I just decided to stop, I don't get how I spent hours testing my skills and Weapon control to someone kill me behind a wall, Operator players using 144hz monitor and other hardware better than mine. Instalock duelist, closed parties and so much more.  
I just don't know what comes next, I can't mute them like other fps because I need the communication, I can't carry because 2 shots kills me easy, the player base is bellow 20 years old so you know how hell it is. 😭",1689289753.0

Everyone acts all nice in the beginning but the second the game ends they start talking shit. People talk shit in low elo to but at least they say it to your face most of the time. In Acendant everyone is a pussy ass mf who can't say anything until the end of the game cuz they got zero talking skills do to their lack of touching grass. It's pretty easy to tell who is gonna shit talk at the end of the game but it's just annoying cuz u can't say anything until they talk first which leads to u not getting a word in.

My biggest complaint about VALORANT.,0,14zclr8,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14zclr8/my_biggest_complaint_about_valorant/,15,"Why is Riot making everything so incredibly competitive? Why are there no relaxed game modes that focus on learning and enjoying the game without a win condition? Deathmatch is a race to reach 40, unrated seems like a second version of ranked, and even team deathmatch is a race to reach 100. Moreover, all of these game modes also implement skill-based matchmaking (SBMM). I understand that some players can overlook these aspects in modes that are less important than ranked, but I'm a competitive person and if there is something to be won then I want it, dammit. It becomes incredibly stressful for me, and there's very little opportunity to unwind unless I quit the game altogether. Would it be too much to ask for open deathmatch lobbies without a score limit, where players can join or leave as they please? ",1689330020.0

If anyone has advice on not panicking/insta-crouch spraying that would be helpful as well as I feel my aim is solid in DM and TDM but I lose it all in comp and just spray 4 shots to the chest each time.

it's not just 1 friend there are 7-8 friends that's get more RR than me even though I have better score. 

There are also friends who are at the same rank as me but as we climb, they also get higher RR than me even though their score are lower.

if it's because of me, then how can I improve my RR gains.

Does the MMR reset need a rework?,9,14y2wep,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14y2wep/does_the_mmr_reset_need_a_rework/,14,"Honestly, I don't understand what is the point of placing high diamonds in gold/plat, and actual gold players having to face them. In what way does this encourage climbing ranks? 

To put an example, I lost a game to a Reyna diamond 2, placed platinum 2 that went 39/15. 39 KILLS. And I am gold 3. So how exactly do I rank up if every game I have to face diamonds from the previous act? There is always someone getting over 25-30 kills and I just can't beat them. I've even gotten paired against ascendants, like WHAT?

I am not blaming the high ranks, I am blaming this system, you just can't say ""be better"" over someone who is 3 whole ranks above you, it just isn't fair. 

I wouldn't mind if the reset was within your own rank, for example, from dia 3 you go to dia 1 at 0 points or whatever but stay in diamond, why go below that and ruin the matches of those who just got to gold? The diamond player clearly earned their spot there so why remove them?

I am using gold/plat/dia as my examples as I am currently g3 after the reset, but you can imagine how this affects low and higher ranks too.

What do you think? Should any changes be made, should it stay the way it is? ",1689201128.0

"Anyone else finding mic spammers, trolls, and generally unpleasant voice comms more common these days?",8,14xy134,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14xy134/anyone_else_finding_mic_spammers_trolls_and/,2,"I've been playing since Beta and from playing games like CSS/CSGO, League, DOTA, Dirty Bomb, Halo, CoD, Planetside, Warframe and so on. And I've always maintained that I've felt like Valorant has had one of the best, least toxic, and generally positive communities I've ever played in, sincerely. Especially by FPS standards, the people in Valorant are *very* nice and friendly. 

&nbsp;

I've felt like that's changing though. The past 6!!! games I've gotten have had either mic spammers, trolls, or people who are just outright unpleasant to talk to or comm with. Its become a more common sight these days I feel like. Its gotten to the point where I've felt the desire to just automatically mute voice chat when the game starts. It feels like every game I join is filled with some teens moaning in the might, yelling on a low quality mic, shit talking and whining constantly, disparaging the team, etc. 

&nbsp;

Is this the experience with anyone else? I've always been an insanely extroverted, communicative, and outgoing person. I used to make new friends on Valorant every day I played because I would be talking a lot with people. In games like Squad, I would often times take up the role of a leader and communicate with 15 different people at once because I liked that role, I liked talking to people and I was good at it! I'm feeling this less and less with Valorant though. Its insanely discouraging. 

&nbsp;

Also similarly has anyone felt like more people are not using Valorant voice chat and instead using Discord instead? I feel like in many games its obvious I'm not being comm'd with because I'm not in the group VC a 3 or 4 stack is in, so they just don't bother to try and talk with me. I think its a result of degrading communication quality these days IMO.",1689189854.0

I’ve been a controller fps sweat for 20 years so I feel justified giving my input with the natural game sense I’ve built in that time. 

Firstly, I love this character and it suits my playstyle. This isn’t a deadlock bad post. 

- Several surfaces block sound sensors. Anything that isn’t a smooth texture is finicky to place on, and some smooth textures aren’t placeable at all. Inside A main on Split, for example. You can’t sensor the darker gray bottom portion of the entry. There are several instances across maps where sensors have a flat surface but are unplaceable, and then most textures that aren’t smooth (like criss crossed boards) require some perfect angle to find a sensor spot. 

Without being able to place on the floor/ceiling to compensate, I hate this. 

- The ult. I don’t think it needs talked about much. We’re all aware of the hot mess it is right now. It’s a wildly fun ult to use, be it predicting enemies, trapping with the grav net for a free grab, forcing a trade on attack in a 1v1 last standing scenario, it has a ton of utility. It’s just so wildly inconsistent regarding things it will get stuck on, sometimes catching people outside the tunnel while other times missing people in the center of it, cocoon’s seemingly varied hp in some instances. Yikes. 

- Grav net seems close but doesn’t seem quite utile enough. Probably just my low elo games here. 

All in all, she’s such a fun character. On attack or defense, I feel like I have so much control over the entire round so long as I’m reading enemy movement right.

I started to play valorant recently and there's one thing that completely ruins experience for me,4,14xukqa,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14xukqa/i_started_to_play_valorant_recently_and_theres/,6,"Recently i decided to give valorant a try even though i am not particularly a good competitive online shooter player and hate CS's gunplay mechanics. But still it's one of the most popular games on the market and Riot is famous for everything with their name on it (except for lol for some reason) being an absolute win. I've played like 10 matches so far and my overall experience was kinda okay. Except for on crucial thing that was ruined every of those matches for me. I am yet to have a match where every player stick from start to finish. Every time some team gains even slightest lead, someone instantly disconnects. It feels like i can't even learn the game because it's always one team dominanting another not by skill, but because some dude decided mid match that he doesn't feel like playing anymore. Unless there's some gamedesign intention to have 4 men fight 5, i feel pretty confident that i am yet to experience this game for what developers intended. Is there any penalty for leaving a normal match? Because it really feels like not or if there's one, it is so insignificant that nobody's gonna stick around in matches where there isn't 100% chance of winning. Obviously I've been playing normals where penalty shouldn't be too harsh, but i really don't think that i should go in ranked with my atrocious gunfight skill and ruin experience for everyone. But maybe leaving during matches is considered a norm here. I really don't know and want to hear some experienced players' insight on this matter",1689181961.0

\- complete all your weeklies

\- complete all your dailies on every day ==> 80 min per day (8x team deatchmatch)

\- when missed on one day you need to play 110 extra minutes on another day to compensate

This results in a minimum required time of \~75h per battle pass...

As somebody with restricted time this is really frustrating :'(

Since the release of Team Deathmatch I have been using it as a warm-up and then going straight to ranked. The problem is.... I'm insane in deathmatch, sometimes pop-off insanely in ranked but most of the time im just... bad.

From all the 20 games of Team Deathmatch that I've played, I've gotten 17 Match MVPs averaging 30kills+ wiith my highest being 52 kills. The other 3 matches i got 3rd, 4th and 5th.

To be honest I don't know what my problem is. Is it ranked stress? Deathmatch confidence? Not playing the same? (clearly).

I no longer use crouch at all since it affected my dueling (imo). Does anyone have any ideas of what i can do?

My last two matches were a 51 kills Team Deathmatch and straight away went to comp. I went like 1-14 and just gave up. Im on the verge of madness.",1689212206.0

I was the same way, every bad game would cause me to get upset. When I was upset, it became more difficult to focus, but I was also blaming everything for my death besides for myself. So, one day a couple weeks ago, in a ranked match, I met arguably the nicest people I met playing this game. I remember we lost that game, and I hadn't done so well. However, those peoples kindness sort of relieved me in a way. After that, my mindset shifted. I started approaching my team with a kinder approach. I'll hop on the mic during selection and jus say hello and ask how peoples days went. During games, when I die, I don't get tilted and start blaming everything else, I simply say wp or ns, then compliment some way on how they outplayed me. This helps me identify what I did wrong to lose and die, but also I've noticed people can't really talk down on you if you're doing nothing but being nice to them. Since this mindset change, I have felt an overall improvement on not only my team, nor the lobby, but I feel like I'm improving way faster than I was before , because I am identifying my mistakes, and ENJOYING when I play, even if I am not doing the best.

It looks very useful to get information about the defenders' formation and hit their weaker site.

Anyway, I tried to replicate that in my Bronze lobby during buy rounds, where I comm my intention to default. I also comm to not commit to any site till we have enough information. But more often than not, 4 of my fellow teammates will go the other site, and will hit it before I get any information about the other site. Or they ignore my comms to rotate, when I have a clear or have cleared the other site.

And when they die, more often than not they will flame me for being a lurking Reyna. Whereas my main idea is not about lurking but defaulting. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!",1689208420.0

Creating a Woohoojin/Valorant Documentary,0,14xx82v,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14xx82v/creating_a_woohoojinvalorant_documentary/,3,"Hey I’m a small Valorant Youtuber, bvtter, looking to create a Documentary about **Woohoojin** and **Valorant**. I want to find players with *any* experience watching Woohoojin, any experience in his community and how it’s impacted your experience with Valorant and Ranking up.

&#x200B;

If you’re curious here’s a short example with **my own story**:

When I first started watching Woohoojin, I was a brand new Bronze player looking to rank up, and as all new low elo players do. I looked up tips and tricks on Youtube, at first all the videos I found were extremely generic and things I had already heard a million times, nothing really substantial or all that helpful. That was until I found a Woohoojin Video, **“Gunfight Hygiene”**. It completely changed how I took duels in Valorant. Eventually leading me to Silver, but I wanted more, and as a result I ended up finding Woohoojins **“One Month To Gold”** Routine. This routine not only made me a Platinum player but also a long-time viewer and member of the community.

&#x200B;

Of course your own story could be as brief as “I enjoyed one video and it helped me with a concept in Valorant” or as long as explaining how, “the community completely changed how you see Valorant, Aim, and Gaming”. **All experiences, ranks and backgrounds are welcome.**

&#x200B;

If you’re interested in being apart of this Documentary in any way please reach out.

I would love to speak to players with experiences in discord vc's, but I also really appreciate written out responses as well.

I will be reading responses in the comments, my DMs, and my Discord: @ bvtter\_

Thank you for reading!

What agent to play it with, when to buy, which spots on which maps to hold with it, how to attack with it, practice routines etc.

I thought of the Operator as an overpowered but boring weapon that needed patience till I watched a professional player named KangKang, who currently plays for the Chinese pro Val team EDward Gaming, use the Operator at the Masters Tokyo event and since then I've been obsessed.

[https://youtu.be/aOWh9JlV\_gM?t=135](https://youtu.be/aOWh9JlV_gM?t=135)

I've been buying the OP a lot since watching the event and sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. I'll be holding Pearl B long I've figured out that I can't die with it at least for 2 rounds after I buy it, regardless of kills, and per round it's not great value unless I can get a 2k at least. A common scenario is I'll be holding Pearl B long from hall and I'll get one kill before getting traded instantly by a Vandal. If I am lucky I escape with one body shot then re-peek and get a second frag before getting traded. I have better success when attacking from Ascent mid-top, I don't know why I just find it easier to re-adjust my aim across the various potential enemy peek spots.

I want to improve with the weapon. I don't have crazy ambitions of becoming Radiant or becoming a pro player or streamer, I have a full time job so I get to play max 1-2 hours a day. I love the weapon, it's an absolute thrill to play with it. Almost match-winning potential on it's own, and it can completely fuck your economy up for several rounds if you buy it and lose your first duel.

Across over 300 kills this person has maintained almost a 70% hs.

This person was consistently at the top of the leaderboard. My other friends who are in the higher immortal to low radiant elo range don't typically have that high of a hs%, even on their alts. A little deeper digging showed that in previous acts his vandal hs% hovered around the mid 30s to low 40s, which is still high but not quite 70% high. 

I was curious to see what people's thoughts were on at what point you'd consider the possibility of a cheater versus just being a powerhouse smurf. Especially in light of vanguard being out of compliance and thus not running properly on some windows 10 OS builds currently

His C and Q abilities are either fucking bullets or an instant Jett dash. Then his X is an operator. This man is not a sentinel! This man is CLEARLY an ARMORY.

That one trip is keeping him his sentinel role, however I don’t buy it. During the last change to his gameplay, which was [patch 6.11](https://esi.si.com/valorant/valorant-patch-6-11-chamber-pearl) you can clearly read that they focused on BUFFING his guns.

The guides that say you must change these settings and the one after literally says the opposite

They say just play the game and you'll climb out but I've literally gone no where TT

Introducing Valodle.eu: A New Game of Daily Valorant Agent Guessing,249,14wbz62,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14wbz62/introducing_valodleeu_a_new_game_of_daily/,78,"Hello everyone!

I'm thrilled to introduce you all to my newly created website - [**Valodle.eu**](https://www.valodle.eu/)!

In essence, Valodle.eu is inspired by the concept of Loldle (for those who aren't familiar). The primary objective is to test your Valorant knowledge every day by guessing the randomly selected agent. It's a fun way to challenge your memory and maybe even learn something new about the agents that you didn't know before!

But that's not all! I've got a lot of exciting things planned for Valodle in the future. One of the features that I'm particularly thrilled to introduce is a Geo Guesser mode. In this mode, players will need to identify the map based on a screenshot. It's a fun, innovative, and challenging twist that I hope will keep you engaged and guessing!

Additionally, another game mode that's in the works will require players to identify the name of a weapon skin from an image. This will certainly be a challenge for even the most die-hard Valorant fans, as it will test not only your knowledge of the game's weaponry but also your attention to detail.

And of course, there are many more features and modes that I'm looking forward to introducing. Valodle is all about making the world of Valorant more interactive and engaging, while also providing a fun and challenging gaming experience.

I would love for you all to visit the site, give it a try, and let me know your thoughts. Your feedback will be instrumental in making Valodle the best it can be. I'm looking forward to hearing what you think and seeing you there!

Happy guessing, everyone!

Hard reset every new episode is a good thing for people who play alot at higher ranks. Heres why.,0,14xc12r,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14xc12r/hard_reset_every_new_episode_is_a_good_thing_for/,3,"Valorant has this very awful feature where every new act, all you have to do is play one  game, win or lose and you’re placed at the same rank you hit last act. Meaning people can just grind the start of the new episode, reach their peak rank and just play 1 game each new act and stay the same rank. I think this is a horrible feature in higher ranks where people play hours upon hours. Getting one of these players that plays only like 3 games an act is a guaranteed loss. This is probably the reason why you find yourself saying “ how is this person not in iron?” Its probably because they havent played in months. And thanks for valorants rank system they’re allowed to play in the peak elo they hit in the beginning of the act.



I think this is incredibly harmful for the game and the player. That is why, the beginning of each act are the best games you’re going to get the entire episode. Once you climb back to your peak after the rank reset, you will find that the majority of the players there are also players like you putting in a lot of hours to reach their rank again. The games dont feel one sided, you dont have teamates droping zero kills in 20 rounds. I think its the best time to climb to a higher rank. 

I would suggest that the amount of games played within the act determines your rank for the next act. Someone that has played one f** game the whole act should not end up the same rank as their previous act. That causes horrible unbalanced, unwinable games. I also think the reset shouldnt matter. I was ascendant 2 and got placed diamond 1. If you’re a playing consistently, you should get back to your main rank pretty quickly.",1689130870.0

People also revive almost instantly after dying so you can’t revive them at all, making her ult one of the most useless in this game mode. I was thinking what if they rework sage specifically for this game mode, like making her ult heal in an area instead of the revive and reduce her healing orb cooldown to heal more frequently, cuz healing in this mode is easier to get than in unrated and it’s not that valuable as you can respawn. Also the cooldown of her wall is like 90 seconds, and it’s not worth it at all as enemies can just shoot at it without having to worry about dying as the will instantly revive and can continue to break the wall.. so what do you think? Does she need a rework only for this game mode?",1689020231.0

When told to stay calm and to remember tracking the enemies head, I was top fragging once with a lot of headshots than I usually do. After a while watching the videos over and over to remind myself doesn't help anymore even if I do practice.

Most of the time my aim sucks. I guess it has to do with panic bursting and my aim in general. Sorry I do not have a recording to show for review. My confidence usually plunges down when faced with enemies in a deadly situation.
I can't even play duelist without fighting my thoughts or without a friend lol! 


Competitive games really sucks when you have low confidence I guess. I'm fighting against those thoughts but it can't be done in one day...I rarely crouch and I try to deadzone a lot (I prob still isn't good with it) while in game I always forget to shoot head as all I'm focused with is killing the enemies.. 

The key is probably to play a lot since I only started last February, but yeah I still enjoy the game I'm just sad that I don't headshot a lot.  My overall % for headshot is like... Only 8.4% ... Body 80.8% :/ it probably doesn't matter as long as you kill an enemy and win the round but I want to improve on that... 


I'm in bronze 1 last act I was silver 1 and it's hard to get out of bronze rn somehow people are just too good! But it's not like i wanna give up cus i love the game I'm just ranting and sad. I love Valorant sm. 


Maybe I could get some even more tips, things to remember and more vids to absorb. Like a keyword or a sentence I won't ever forget to remind myself I can do it :))

I created Killjoy her Chicken Turret in real life!!! Here you can see it:

It's 77cm in height, but I added wheels to it. At some point I want to make the turret remote controllable so I dont need to drag it along with a little rope on conventions.

&#x200B;

Also some other cool stuff I have made: 

Glitchpop Dagger WITH LEDS!

This was a hard challenge cus it was my first ever LED project. But I love it!!!

I haven't been fortunate enough ( yet) to earn this one in game so I decided to make it as a keychain. And people are in love with it!

&#x200B;

And to show more addiction, I got the VCT logo tattoo'ed.

I don't know if this is a lore thing or just riot not having ideas but I've noticed that sentinels and duelists are heavily one sided in terms of humans and/or radiants. With sentinels sage is the only radiant of the bunch. And with Deadlock now in the game it means there are 5 sentinels and one of them is radiant. (I'm pretty sure that's the lore name for the characters with supernatural powers but correct me if I'm wrong). And this ratio is even worse with duelists. There are 6 duelists (I think) and raze is the only human duelist. So what's the deal with this. I'm not criticizing riot I'm just curious. I'd personally love to see more human duelists.

Completely Separate MMR Per Mode Ruins Casual Mode for Low Elo Players,5,14wee19,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14wee19/completely_separate_mmr_per_mode_ruins_casual/,47,"I understand that the competitive integrity of the more casual modes isn't nearly as important as in the main Comp mode and speed of matchmaking is generally more important with each team in my reference game being roughly balanced out, but I think there should still be a rank distance cap or relative range, especially for people who are soloQ-ing or who are with people that are super close to their rank. I use TDM and Deathmatch to warm up and find it incredibly frustrating to queue into people from Diamond all the way to high tier pro play and essentially get forced to waste five to ten minutes just getting rolled by people better than me. I can't imagine how irritating it is for your average Joe to just be getting on to have fun with their buds and end up queuing into SR vIc or something because they happen to be on a bit of a winstreak that night.

Edit: For those of you saying to just play ranked, two points. 

1: If I only have 45 minutes to play on a given day, I can't guarantee that I'd be able to play the whole game if it goes to later rounds or OT. 

2: If I die in a round, I'm out for the round, if I die in TDM, I'm back in a gunfight within 10-15 seconds or faster if I pick Raze or Neon, which would be a far more time efficient way to practice.

I haven't played the game in a long time, maybe even a year. I had an account that was in the Gold 3 to Platinum 1 range, but my skill has dropped a bit so I decided to create a new account for this Act and start fresh. I've been playing for a couple weeks now and just unlocked Ranked, upon which I immediately played all five of my placement games. The game placed me in Gold 2, which surprised me quite a bit. I expected to get Bronze or even Silver at best, especially considering I didn't perform well for 3 out of 5 of my placements.

He has three charges of his signature, which are a type of smoke named Meteor. You place landing points in his “Astral” form and the come down in meteorites before dissolving into a dust cloud. Anyone in the are the land in gets concussed. His second ability is called Epicentre. He places a centre point and a semi-large radius around is concussed every 2 seconds for 10 seconds. The closer you are to the centre, the longer you’re concussed for. His final ability excluding his ultimate is called Sandstorm. It is basically Harbour’s cascade except it gives you a Reyna blind effect. You use it by placing a start point in the Astral form. His ultimate is called Eruption. You use it by placing a point in his Astral form and a volcano forms there. Every five seconds the volcano erupts, sending up a damaging geyser of fire and throwing out what is essentially a Phoenix molly in a random direction. This lasts for 15 seconds.

My team dont want me to play yoru(me and my friend argument),0,14wm6go,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14wm6go/my_team_dont_want_me_to_play_yorume_and_my_friend/,4,"I am a plat2 player.  From the start reyna and chamber were my solid choice because I want a ability which  can get 1v1 and escape for another 1v1. In reyna its her dismiss and chamber it is teleport. After the chamber nerf I stop using him since even for a sentinel he became a bad choice.

Which led me to play reyna(150hours) but lately I started seeing the disadvantage of reyna, I am forced to take 50/50 fight (her blind sucks). So I switched to yoru on last act. Yoru is a good agent for me since it have a amazing flash and a way to escape bad situation. 

I  am top fragging most of the times and playing the dualist role better than before, more confident in ult and supporting team is gotten much better since I can just tp in a sec from site to site. But here is the problem.

My teammate which I am playing with since the start of my valo journey, complains that I flash them which I dont think is true. There been only few situation where I flashed them by mistake, for example- on bind 'A' site, I am about to peak through showers to give my team more area to work from, so rather than peaking raw, I threw a flash on the entrance and it got my friend flash who was planting. That was my fault indeed but it was not a selfish flash. Another time it happened which started this argument. 

The map is pearl and I am taking A main control alone to kill the lurker cypher, I slowly pushed to their spawn to clear mid but I see that my team is struggling to hold B control because of enemy being 5stack. I decided to go fast flank to divide the enemy team which will help my team on B to have an number advantage. I am on b club and I saw fade on ramp, as soon I shot at her,  timing happened and she moved to go to main. My omen(friend) decided to TP using his ult near me and I knew he is there. My gamesense said that fade gonna peak me, so I flashed at her direction to get advantage, as soon as the flash popet my omen peak from cover and got flashed, I died from fade because I missed first shot and she probably saw me before the flash popet. Fade also killed omen by skill not because omen was blind.

My friend argument was ""I dont call my flash"", my argument was ""In situation like this which need fast decision making, I cannot change my focus to calling for flash"", He said its stupid.  He started saying again that I need to stop playing yoru even though I am top fragging in most matches, I am the one who is entering site and taking control of hard areas like B tunnel and B link. The talk went like this  
Me: ""I am top fragging matches then why should I stop playing yoru. I am getting kill and having impact on the rounds"".   
friend: ""Exit frag dont have impact on the round and you said a dualist should not be the last person alive""  
me: ""I am getting 1-3 kills when entering a site and after we have man advantage, why would I get myself into pointless fight where I dont even have my abilities left""

I mean i get that in unrated the cooldowns should be long as it’s more of a tactical shooter, but in team death match you respawn almost instantly after dying, so I don’t get why the cooldowns should be this long if people are rushing all the time, you could finish a match without ever charging your ult. They could reduce the cooldowns a little bit but not till the point it becomes like Overwatch. For example, i was trying deadlock today and the cooldown of her barrier was almost a minute. I mean enemies have infinite ammo so that wall won’t do much, more over they won’t care if their position is revealed when shooting the wall cuz the will respawn like 2 seconds later… so do you also think some abilities need a slight cooldown reduction?",1689019952.0

[AS YOU CAN SEE TARIQ \(Image found in brimstones office\) AND KAYO'S DESIGN IS SIMILAR ON THE BOTTOM HALF OF HIS HEAD AND IF THEY ALSO HAVE SIMILAR HEADSHAPES \(if you shave Tariq's beard\), If you look at it closely the beard and kayos metal that covers the bottom half of his head are similar  \(Also it isn't really a feature but the top part of KAY\/O's face? is darker which could represent hair but that's a  new level of grasping\)](https://preview.redd.it/75xht2fje8bb1.png?width=146&format=png&auto=webp&s=711e1f8ffeaf0d291591f508759fb0574cbf14ec)

Now is this all a convoluted mess that makes 0 sense if you think about it, yes but is it also correct 100% and if a rioter comes here and says anything im putting it in inspect element to make me correct

What i love about Valorant,0,14wf8ml,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14wf8ml/what_i_love_about_valorant/,3," The game features two teams of five players each, with one team defending and the other attacking. In the attacking team, players must plant a bomb in a designated area, while the defending team tries to prevent them from doing so. The game is won by either detonating the bomb or eliminating all opponents. Valorant’s gameplay involves strategizing, teamwork, and skill, making it a highly competitive game. Each agent has unique abilities, including healing, teleportation, and invisibility, which add a layer of complexity to the gameplay. The game requires players to use their abilities smartly and work together to outmaneuver their opponents. One of the biggest features of Valorant is its striking art style and graphics. The game has a modern and futuristic aesthetic with beautifully designed maps, character models, and animations. The sound design is also impressive, with realistic gun sounds and voice lines that add to the immersive experience,

i also love this game because it has cute characters and cool gunskins

why does it seem like low elo players are allergic to playing strategically?,350,14v1bo1,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14v1bo1/why_does_it_seem_like_low_elo_players_are/,167,"I've only been playing roughly for about 4 months and managed to get a rank of bronze 1(I know this is still low). One thing I noticed, people don't/won't play to their advantage in post-plant, spike dropped or in numbers. I know I make mistakes in my plays and still have a lot to learn about the game.

In one match it was a 1v1 we were on attack. The remaining player in my team (Jett) was able to plant the spike(A). Instead of holding down the site, she went off to look for the remaining Cypher.  Cypher got to defuse while my teammate was in market.

In another match it was 2v1 the spike was dropped in t-spawn. I pinged the spike and said in comms help me defend the spike. But no, the player proceeded to go to and camp in (A lotus). I lost my 1v1 and the opponent planted in C, camped there, and got the clutch.

Another scenario 3v1. instead of playing together, all 3 went off separate ways which gave the opponent 1v1s which they lost.

I see this pattern in over and over. Majority of the time players don't listen/read comms or evaluate the situation.

Since then I've played basically every popular FPS on console and got very mechanically talented. If there was a ranked system I'd get max. If there was a leaderboard, I'd get on it. I even played in smaller tournament scenes for games like overwatch, apex and warzone 1.

I always end up with my wrist on the corner of the desk or my arm is uncomfortable on the top its all just a mess.

The amount of “smurf” and “instalock reyna lurker” copium is insane in this reddit.,0,14w4ktv,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/14w4ktv/the_amount_of_smurf_and_instalock_reyna_lurker/,4,The amount of post and comments I see everyday of low elo players complaining about not being able to win because of smurfs destroying their shit or duelist not entrying is pathetic. Y’all simply lack accountability. I look at the trackers you guys post and the “Smurf” on the other team is just some average .9 kd bronze 1 player who had a good game against you because you went 4-18 and were a free kill on the map and capitalized. The same way that reyna can’t effectively entry is the same way you can’t effectively use your util. I’m not saying these things don’t happen but at the end of the day you just aren’t good enough yet.,1689019315.0
